Database Requirements for MySQL / MariaDB
-----------------------------------------

The following is currently required if you're running ownCloud together with a MySQL / MariaDB database:

* Disabled or BINLOG_FORMAT = MIXED configured Binary Logging (See: :ref:`db-binlog-label`)
* InnoDB storage engine (MyISAM is not supported, see: :ref:`db-storage-engine-label`)
* "READ COMMITED" transaction isolation level (See: :ref:`db-transaction-label`)
