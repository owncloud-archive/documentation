NOTE: If you are an administrator, you can also manage users and administer the server. These links do not appear to a non-admin user.

The options listed in the Personal Settings Page depend on the
applications that are enabled by the administrator. Some of the features
you will see include the following.

* Usage and available quota
* Manage your profile picture.
* Full name. You can make this anything you want, as it is separate from
your ownCloud login name, which is unique and cannot be changed.
* Email address.
* Lists your Group memberships.
* Manage your password.
* userpreferences.
* Choose the language for your ownCloud interface.
* Links to desktop and mobile apps.
* Manage your Activity stream and notifications.
* Default folder to save new documents to.
* Your Federated sharing ID.
* Social sharing links.
* ownCloud version.
