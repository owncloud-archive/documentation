== File Troubleshooting

Listed here are the most common errors you may encounter while
attempting to upload files, along with what they mean, and possible
workarounds.

[[error-while-copying-file-to-target-location-copied-bytes-xxx-expected-filesize-yyy]]
== Error while copying file to target location (copied bytes: xxx, expected filesize: yyy)

This error is most likely due to an issue with the target storage
location. During file uploads the file data is read from PHP input and
copied into a part file on the target storage. 

If the target storage is not local (eg: FTP) and that storage is slow, not available, or broken
it is likely that the operation will fail either at the beginning, or in
the middle of the copy. Other reasons for this message can be that, when
writing to external storage, the connection took too long to respond or
the network connection was flaky.

[[sharing-sidebar-does-not-show-shared-with-you-by-for-remote-shares]]
== Sharing sidebar does not show ``Shared with you by …'' for remote shares

In some scenarios, when users share folders and files with each other
they cannot be scanned. There are a variety of reasons why this happens,
which can include firewalls and broken servers. 

In these situations, when the initial scan did not complete successfully, the mount point
cannot appear in the ownCloud web UI. This is because ownCloud was not
able to generate a matching file cache entry, nor retrieve any metadata
about whether it’s a folder or file (mime type), etc.

== PIM Troubleshooting

BlackBerry OS up to 10.2.2102 does not accept a URL with protocol
`https://` in front of the server address. It will always tell you that
it cannot login on your server. So instead of writing:

....
https://example.com/remote.php/dav/principals/users/USERNAME/
....

in the server address field, you have to write:

....
example.com/remote.php/dav/principals/users/USERNAME/
....
