WebUI Overview
==============

You can access your files with the ownCloud Web interface, as well as:
_create_, _preview_, _edit_, _delete_, _share_, and _re-share_ files.

Your ownCloud administrator has the option to disable these features. If
any of them are missing on your system ask your server administrator.
