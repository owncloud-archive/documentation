Navigating the WebUI
====================

Navigating through folders in ownCloud is as simple as clicking on a
folder to open it and using the back button on your browser to move to a
previous level. This section walks you through how to navigate the
ownCloud UI.

[[create-and-upload-files-and-directories]]
Create and Upload Files and Directories
---------------------------------------

At the top of the Files view is a navigation bar. This contains links to
uploading new files, and creating new files and folders.

To upload or create new files or folders directly in an ownCloud folder
click on the _New_ button in the navigation bar (this is the `+`
button). There, as in the image above, you can see links to:

* **Upload a new file:** This uploads files from your computer into
ownCloud. You can also upload files by dragging and dropping them from
your file manager.
* **Create a new text file:** This creates a new text file and adds the
file to your current folder.
* *Create a new folder:* This creates a new folder in the current
folder.

[[select-files-or-folders]]
Select Files or Folders
-----------------------

You can select one or more files or folders by hovering over them (as in
the image below) and clicking on their checkboxes. To select all files
in the current directory, click on the checkbox located at the top of
the files listing.

When you select multiple files, you can delete all of them, or download
them as a ZIP file by using the `Delete` or `Download` buttons that
appear at the top.

NOTE: If the `Download` button is not visible, the administrator has disabled this feature.

[[filter-the-files-view]]
Filter the Files View
---------------------

The left sidebar on the Files page contains several filters for quickly
sorting and managing your files.

[[move-files]]
Move Files
----------

You can move files and folders by dragging and dropping them into any
directory.

[[play-videos]]
Play Videos
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can play videos in ownCloud with the Video Player app, by clicking
once on the file. Please note, video streaming by the native ownCloud
video player depends on your Web browser and the video’s format.

[NOTE]
====
If your ownCloud administrator has enabled video streaming, and it
doesn’t work in your Web browser, it may be a browser-related issue. See
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats#Browser_compatibility
for supported multimedia formats in Web browsers.

[[settings]]
Settings
~~~~~~~~

The *Settings* gear icon, in the lower left-hand corner of the ownCloud
window, allows you to show or hide hidden files in your ownCloud Web
interface. These are also called dotfiles, because they are prefixed
with a dot, e.g. `.mailfile`.

The dot tells your operating system to hide these files in your file
browsers, unless you choose to display them. Usually, these are
configuration files, so having the option to hide them reduces clutter.

[[preview-files]]
Preview Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ownCloud can display thumbnail previews for _images_, _MP3 covers_, and
_text files_, if this is enabled by your server administrator. You can
also display _uncompressed text_, _OpenDocument_, _videos_, and _image_
files in the ownCloud embedded viewers by clicking on the file name.
There may be other file types you can preview if your ownCloud
administrator has enabled them. If ownCloud cannot display a file, it
will start a download process and downloads the file to your computer.
