Sharing Files
=============

Clicking the share icon on any file or folder opens the Details view on
the right, where the Share tab has focus.

[[sharing-status-icons]]
Sharing Status Icons
--------------------

Any folder that has been shared is marked with the `Shared` overlay
icon. Public link shares are marked with a chain link. Un-shared folders
are blank.

If your ownCloud server is the Enterprise edition, you may also have
access to Sharepoint and Windows Network Drive file shares. These have
special status icons. An icon with a red plugin and background means you
have to enter a login to get access to the share.

[[creating-shares]]
Creating Shares
---------------

To share a file or folder, immediately below the Share tab, you will see
a text field. In this field, you can enter any number of users (whether
local to your ownCloud server or remote) or groups who you would like to
share the file or folder with.

If username auto-completion is enabled, when you start typing the user
or group name ownCloud will automatically complete it for you, if
possible.

From 10.0.8, user and group name search results are dependent on a new
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters.html[configuration
setting], called `user.search_min_length` (it is set to 4 by default).
This setting helps to aid search performance but requires that search
terms contain at least the defined number of characters. Consequently,
search terms shorter than the defined number of characters will not
return a list of matches. However, they will return an existing user or
group with a name of the same length as the search term.

After a file or folder has been shared, link:[Share Permissions] can be
set on it. In the image below, you can see that the directory
``event-Photos'' is shared with the user ``pierpont'', who can _share_,
_edit_, _create_, _change_, and _delete_ the directory.

[[what-happens-when-share-recipients-move-files-and-folders]]
What Happens When Share Recipients Move Files and Folders?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a share recipient has ``**can edit**'' privileges and moves files or
folders out of the share, ownCloud stores a backup copy of the moved
file/folder in the Deleted Files (Trash) of the share’s owner. The user
who moved the file/folder out of the share still has the original copy
there, along with its attached metadata.

That way, the files/folders are not permanently lost. By clicking the
*Restore* link, next to the respective file or folder, ownCloud will
restore these files/folders to their original location.

image:/owncloud-docs/user_manual/_images/sharing/restore-files.png[image]

Restoring files restores the backup copy for *all users*, including the
user that originally moved them, into the original folder.

[[sharing-files-with-guest-users]]
Sharing Files with Guest Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can also share files and folders with guest users. To do so, your
ownCloud administrator will need to have installed
https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/guests[the Guest application].

If it’s already installed, in the ``**User and Groups**'' field of the
``**Sharing**'' panel, type the email address of a user who is not
already a user in your ownCloud installation. You will then see a popup
appear with the suffix `(guest)`, as in the screenshot below.

image:/owncloud-docs/user_manual/_images/guest-users/share-with-guest-users.png[Sharing with guest users.]

After you do that, the content will be shared with the user with all
permissions applied, except for the ability to share with other users.

[[updating-shares]]
Updating Shares
---------------

To change any of the properties of a share, again, you first need to
view the Share tab. From there, you can:

* Delete a user’s access to a share
* Give more users access to a share
* Change a user’s share permissions
* Add or remove password protection
* Set or remove a share’s expiration date

As this functionality is already described in other parts of the
link:[Sharing Files] section, it won’t be specifically covered here.

[[deleting-shares]]
Deleting Shares
---------------

Despite the name of this section, you don’t actually delete a share.
Rather what you do is remove the access of user’s to whom it’s already
been shared with. When all users access to a shared resource has been
removed, the resource is no longer shared.

To do that, you need to click on the rubbish bin icon, on the far
right-hand side of the name of each user it’s been shared with, who
should no longer have access to it.

[[password-protecting-files]]
Password Protecting Files
-------------------------

It’s also possible to password protect shared files and folders. If you
want to do so, then you need to enable this functionality. Specifically,
click the checkbox labeled ``__Password protect__'' under the ``__Share
Link__'' section.

When you do so, you’ll see a password field appear. In there, add the
password that the user will need to enter to access the shared resource
and press the return key.

[[using-private-links]]
Using Private Links
-------------------

Another way to access a file or folder is via a private link. It’s a
handy way of creating a permanent link for yourself or to point others
to a file or folder, within a share, more efficiently. To access the
private link, in the Sharing Panel for a file or folder, next to its
name you’ll see a small link icon (1), as in the screenshot below.

image:/owncloud-docs/user_manual/_images/public-link/private-link.png[Obtaining a private link for a shared file or folder]

If you click it, a new textbox will appear above the ``**Collaborative
tags**'' field, populated with the link’s URI (2).

Only people who have access to the file or folder can use the link.

[[changing-the-share-expiration-date]]
Changing The Share Expiration Date
----------------------------------

In older versions of ownCloud, you could set an expiration date on both
local and public shares. Since the most recent version three, key,
changes have been made:

* You can _only_ set an expiration date on public shares
* Local shares do not expire when public shares expire
* A local share can only be ``expired'' (or deleted) by clicking the
trash can icon

[[creating-or-connecting-to-federation-share-links]]
Creating or Connecting to Federation Share Links
------------------------------------------------

Federated Cloud Sharing allows you to mount file shares from remote
ownCloud servers, and manage them just like a local share. In ownCloud 8
the process for creating a new sharing link is easier and more
streamlined. See ../federated_cloud_sharing to learn to how to create
and connect to new Federated Cloud shares.

[[share-permissions]]
Share Permissions
-----------------

Shares can have a combination of the following five permission types:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Permission |Definition
|can share |Allows the users you share with to re-share

|can edit |Allows the users you share with to edit your shared files,
and to

| |collaborate using the Documents app

|create |Allows the users you share with to create new files and add
them

| |to the share

|change |Allows uploading a new version of a shared file and replacing
it

|delete |Allows the users you share with to delete shared files
|=======================================================================

[[creating-drop-folders]]
Creating Drop Folders
---------------------

As of ownCloud version 10.0.2, users can create upload-only, public
shares (otherwise known as ``Drop Folders''). Drop Folders allow users
to upload files to a central location, but don’t allow them to either
see or change any existing files, which already have been uploaded.

image:/owncloud-docs/user_manual/_images/sharing/create-drop-folder.png[Create a Drop Folder]

To create one:

1.  View the sharing panel of the folder that you want to share as a
Drop Folder, and under *``Public Links''* select *``Create public
link''*.
2.  As with other shares, provide the name in the *``Link Name''* field.
3.  Check *``Allow editing''*, un-check *``Show file listing''*, and
then un-check *``Allow editing''*.
4.  Finally, click *``Save''* to complete creation of the share.

Now, as with other public links, you can copy the link to the share and
give it out, as and when necessary.

[[using-drop-folders]]
Using Drop Folders
------------------

image:/owncloud-docs/user_manual/_images/sharing/use-drop-folders.png[Using Drop Folders]

When users open the share link, they will see a page where they can
either click to select files to share, or drag-and-drop files directly
to share them. After the file’s been successfully uploaded, they’ll see
(where possible) a preview of the file that has been uploaded.
