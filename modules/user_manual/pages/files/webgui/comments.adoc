In ownCloud, you can add one or more comments on both files and folders.
This section describes how to add, edit, and delete comments.

everyone who has access to the file or folder. To add a comment, as in
the example below, click the *Comments* tab in the Details view, write a
comment in the New Comment field, and click "Post".

change your mind, just click _"Cancel"_.
