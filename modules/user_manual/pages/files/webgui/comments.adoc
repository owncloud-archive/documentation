In ownCloud, you can add one or more comments on both files and folders.
This section describes how to add, edit, and delete comments.

everyone who has access to the file or folder. To add a comment, as in
the example below, click the *Comments* tab in the Details view, write a
comment in the New Comment field, and click ``Post''.

Edit Comments

To edit an existing comment on a file or folder, hover the mouse over
the comment and you will see a pencil icon appear. By clicking on the
pencil, the _``Edit Comment''_ field will appear, pre-filled with the
comment text. Change the text as necessary and click _``Save''_. If you
change your mind, just click _``Cancel''_.

To delete an existing comment on a file or folder, as with editing
comments, hover the mouse over the comment and you will see a pencil
icon appear. Click the pencil, and a rubbish bin icon appears on the far
right-hand side of the comment authorâ€™s name, above the _``Edit
Comment''_ text field. Click the rubbish bin, and the comment will be
deleted after a few seconds.
