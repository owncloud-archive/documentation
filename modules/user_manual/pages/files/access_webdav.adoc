= Accessing ownCloud Files Using WebDAV

ownCloud fully supports the WebDAV protocol, and you can connect and
synchronize with your ownCloud files over WebDAV. In this chapter you
will learn how to connect Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, and mobile devices
to your ownCloud server via WebDAV. Before we get into configuring
WebDAV, let’s take a quick look at the recommended way of connecting
client devices to your ownCloud servers.

[[owncloud-desktop-and-mobile-clients]]
== ownCloud Desktop and Mobile Clients

The recommended method for keeping your desktop PC synchronized with
your ownCloud server is by using the
https://owncloud.org/install/#install-clients[ownCloud Desktop Client].
You can configure the ownCloud client to save files in any local
directory you want, and you choose which directories on the ownCloud
server to sync with. The client displays the current connection status
and logs all activity, so you always know which remote files have been
downloaded to your PC, and you can verify that files created and updated
on your local PC are properly synchronized with the server.

The recommended method for syncing your ownCloud server with Android and
Apple iOS devices is by using the
https://owncloud.org/install/#install-clients[ownCloud mobile apps].

To connect to your ownCloud server with the *ownCloud* mobile apps, use
the base URL and folder only:

....
example.com/owncloud
....

In addition to the mobile apps provided by ownCloud, you can use other
apps to connect to ownCloud from your mobile device using WebDAV.
http://seanashton.net/webdav/[WebDAV Navigator] is a good (proprietary)
app for
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.schimera.webdavnavlite[Android
devices],
https://itunes.apple.com/app/webdav-navigator/id382551345[iPhones], and
http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/46816[BlackBerry
devices]. The URL to use on these is:

....
example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/
....

[[webdav-configuration]]
== WebDAV Configuration

If you prefer, you may also connect your desktop PC to your ownCloud
server by using the WebDAV protocol rather than using a special client
application. Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is a
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) extension that makes it easy to
create, read, and edit files on Web servers. With WebDAV you can access
your ownCloud shares on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows in the same way as
any remote network share, and stay synchronized.

NOTE: In the following examples, You must adjust *example.com/* to the URL of your ownCloud server installation.

[[accessing-files-using-linux]]
== Accessing Files Using Linux

You can access files in Linux operating systems using the following
methods.

[[nautilus-file-manager]]
=== Nautilus File Manager

Use the `davs://` protocol to connect the Nautilus file manager to your
ownCloud share:

....
davs://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/
....

NOTE: If your server connection is not HTTPS-secured, use `dav://` instead of `davs://`.

[[accessing-files-with-kde-and-dolphin-file-manager]]
=== Accessing Files with KDE and Dolphin File Manager

To access your ownCloud files using the Dolphin file manager in KDE, use
the `webdav://` protocol:

....
webdav://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/
....

image:/owncloud-docs/user_manual/_images/webdav_dolphin.png[screenshot of configuring Dolphin file manager to use WebDAV]

You can create a permanent link to your ownCloud server:

1.  Open Dolphin and click "Network" in the left hand "Places"
column.
2.  Click on the icon labeled *Add a Network Folder*. The resulting
dialog should appear with WebDAV already selected.
3.  If WebDAV is not selected, select it.
4.  Click *Next*.
5.  Enter the following settings:
* Name: The name you want to see in the *Places* bookmark, for example
ownCloud.
* User: The ownCloud username you used to log in, for example admin.
* Server: The ownCloud domain name, for example *example.com* (without
**http://** before or directories afterwards).
+
* Folder – Enter the path `owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/`.
6.  (Optional) Check the ``Create icon checkbox'' for a bookmark to
appear in the Places column.
7.  (Optional) Provide any special settings or an SSL certificate in the
``Port & Encrypted'' checkbox.

[[creating-webdav-mounts-on-the-linux-command-line]]
== Creating WebDAV Mounts on the Linux Command Line

You can create WebDAV mounts from the Linux command line. This is useful
if you prefer to access ownCloud the same way as any other remote
filesystem mount. The following example shows how to create a personal
mount and have it mounted automatically every time you log in to your
Linux computer.

1.  Install the `davfs2` WebDAV filesystem driver, which allows you to
mount WebDAV shares just like any other remote filesystem. Use this
command to install it on Debian/Ubuntu:
+
....
apt-get install davfs2
....
2.  Use this command to install it on CentOS, Fedora, and openSUSE:
+
....
yum install davfs2    
....
3.  Add yourself to the `davfs2` group:
+
....
usermod -aG davfs2 <username>
....
4.  Then create an `owncloud` directory in your home directory for the
mountpoint, and `.davfs2/` for your personal configuration file:
+
....
mkdir ~/owncloud
mkdir ~/.davfs2
....
5.  Copy `/etc/davfs2/secrets` to `~/.davfs2`:
+
....
cp  /etc/davfs2/secrets ~/.davfs2/secrets 
....
6.  Set yourself as the owner and make the permissions read-write owner
only:
+
....
chown <username>:<username>  ~/.davfs2/secrets
chmod 600 ~/.davfs2/secrets
....
7.  Add your ownCloud login credentials to the end of the `secrets`
file, using your ownCloud server URL and your ownCloud username and
password:
+
....
example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/ <username> <password>
....
8.  Add the mount information to `/etc/fstab`:
+
....
example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/ /home/<username>/owncloud 
davfs user,rw,auto 0 0
....
9.  Then test that it mounts and authenticates by running the following
command. If you set it up correctly you won’t need root permissions:
+
....
mount ~/owncloud
....
10. You should also be able to unmount it:
+
....
umount ~/owncloud
....

Now every time you login to your Linux system your ownCloud share should
automatically mount via WebDAV in your `~/owncloud` directory. If you
prefer to mount it manually, change `auto` to `noauto` in `/etc/fstab`.

[[known-issues]]
== Known Issues

[[problem]]
=== Problem

Resource temporarily unavailable

[[solution]]
=== Solution

If you experience trouble when you create a file in the directory, edit
`/etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf` and add:

....
use_locks 0
....

[[problem-1]]
=== Problem

Certificate warnings

[[solution-1]]
=== Solution

If you use a self-signed certificate, you will get a warning. To change
this, you need to configure `davfs2` to recognize your certificate. Copy
`mycertificate.pem` to `/etc/davfs2/certs/`. Then edit
`/etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf` and uncomment the line `servercert`. Now add
the path of your certificate as in this example:

....
servercert   /etc/davfs2/certs/mycertificate.pem
....

[[accessing-files-using-mac-os-x]]
== Accessing Files Using Mac OS X

NOTE: The Mac OS X Finder suffers from a http://sabre.io/dav/clients/finder/[series of implementation problems] and should only be used if the ownCloud server runs on *Apache* and *mod_php*, or *NGINX 1.3.8+*.

To access files through the Mac OS X Finder:

1.  Choose *Go > Connect to Server*.

_______________________________________
The ``Connect to Server'' window opens.
_______________________________________

1.  Specify the address of the server in the *Server Address* field.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
image:/owncloud-docs/user_manual/_images/osx_webdav1.png[Screenshot of entering your ownCloud server address on Mac OS X]

For example, the URL used to connect to the ownCloud server from the Mac
OS X Finder is:

....
https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/
....

image:/owncloud-docs/user_manual/_images/osx_webdav2.png[image]
________________________________________________________________________________________________

1.  Click *Connect*.

__________________________________
The device connects to the server.

documentation]

[[accessing-files-using-microsoft-windows]]
== Accessing Files Using Microsoft Windows

It is best to use a suitable WebDAV client from the
http://www.webdav.org/projects/[WebDAV Project page] .

If you must use the native Windows implementation, you can map ownCloud
to a new drive. Mapping to a drive enables you to browse files stored on
an ownCloud server the way you would files stored in a mapped network
drive.

Using this feature requires network connectivity. If you want to store
your files offline, use the ownCloud Desktop Client to sync all files on
your ownCloud to one or more directories of your local hard drive.

NOTE: Prior to mapping your drive, you must permit the use of Basic Authentication in the Windows Registry. The procedure is documented in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841215[KB841215] and differs between Windows XP/Server 2003 and Windows Vista/7. Please follow the Knowledge Base article before proceeding, and follow the Vista instructions if you run Windows 7.

[[mapping-drives-with-the-command-line]]
=== Mapping Drives With the Command Line

The following example shows how to map a drive using the command line.
To map the drive:

1.  Open a command prompt in Windows.
2.  Enter the following line in the command prompt to map to the
computer Z drive:
+
....
net use Z: https://<drive_path>/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/ /user:youruser 
yourpassword
....

______________________________________________________
where <drive_path> is the URL to your ownCloud server.
______________________________________________________

For example:
`net use Z: https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/  /user:youruser yourpassword`

___________________________________________________________________________
The computer maps the files of your ownCloud account to the drive letter
Z.
___________________________________________________________________________

NOTE: Though not recommended, you can also mount the ownCloud server using HTTP, leaving the connection unencrypted. If you plan to use HTTP connections on devices while in a public place, we strongly recommend using a VPN tunnel to provide the necessary security.

An alternative command syntax is:

....
net use Z: \\example.com@ssl\owncloud\remote.php\dav /user:youruser 
yourpassword
....

[[mapping-drives-with-windows-explorer]]
=== Mapping Drives With Windows Explorer

To map a drive using the Microsoft Windows Explorer:

1.  Migrate to your computer in Windows Explorer.
2.  Right-click on *Computer* entry and select *Map network drive…* from
the drop-down menu.
3.  Choose a local network drive to which you want to map ownCloud.
4.  Specify the address to your ownCloud instance, followed by
*/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/*.

___________________________________________________________
For example:

....
https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/
....
___________________________________________________________

NOTE: For SSL protected servers, check *Reconnect at logon* to ensure that the mapping is persistent upon subsequent reboots. If you want to connect to the ownCloud server as a different user, check *Connect using different credentials*.

image:/owncloud-docs/user_manual/_images/explorer_webdav.png[image]

1.  Click the `Finish` button.

_________________________________________________________________________________
Windows Explorer maps the network drive, making your ownCloud instance
available.
_________________________________________________________________________________

[[accessing-files-using-cyberduck]]
== Accessing Files Using Cyberduck

https://cyberduck.io/?l=en[Cyberduck] is an open source FTP and SFTP,
WebDAV, OpenStack Swift, and Amazon S3 browser designed for file
transfers on Mac OS X and Windows.

NOTE: This example uses Cyberduck version 4.2.1.

To use Cyberduck:

1.  Specify a server without any leading protocol information. For
example:

_____________
`example.com`
_____________

\2. Specify the appropriate port. The port you choose depends on whether
or not your ownCloud server supports SSL. Cyberduck requires that you
select a different connection type if you plan to use SSL. For example:

____________________________
80 (for WebDAV)

443 (for WebDAV (HTTPS/SSL))
____________________________

\3. Use the `More Options' drop-down menu to add the rest of your WebDAV
URL into the `Path' field. For example:

________________________________
`remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/`
________________________________

Now Cyberduck enables file access to the ownCloud server.

[[accessing-public-shares-over-webdav]]
== Accessing public shares over WebDAV

ownCloud provides the possibility to access public shares over WebDAV.

To access the public share, open:

....
https://example.com/owncloud/public.php/dav
....

in a WebDAV client, use the share token as username and the (optional)
share password as password.

[[known-problems]]
== Known Problems

[[problem-2]]
=== Problem

Windows does not connect using HTTPS.

[[solution-1-1]]
Solution 1
~~~~~~~~~~

The Windows WebDAV Client might not support Server Name Indication (SNI)
on encrypted connections. If you encounter an error mounting an
SSL-encrypted ownCloud instance, contact your provider about assigning a
dedicated IP address for your SSL-based server.

[[solution-2]]
Solution 2
~~~~~~~~~~

The Windows WebDAV Client might not support TSLv1.1 / TSLv1.2
connections. If you have restricted your server config to only provide
TLSv1.1 and above the connection to your server might fail. Please refer
to the
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa382925.aspx#WinHTTP_5.1_Features[WinHTTP]
documentation for further information.

[[problem-3]]
=== Problem

You receive the following error message: *Error 0x800700DF: The file
size exceeds the limit allowed and cannot be saved.*

[[solution-3]]
=== Solution

Windows limits the maximum size a file transferred from or to a WebDAV
share may have. You can increase the value *FileSizeLimitInBytes* in
*HKEY_LOCAL_MacHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters*
by clicking on *Modify*.

To increase the limit to the maximum value of 4GB, select *Decimal*,
enter a value of *4294967295*, and reboot Windows or restart the
*WebClient* service.

[[accessing-files-using-curl]]
== Accessing Files Using cURL

Since WebDAV is an extension of HTTP cURL can be used to script file
operations.

To create a folder with the current date as name:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -u user:pass -X MKCOL "https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/$(date '+%d-%b-%Y')"
----

To upload a file `error.log` into that directory:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -u user:pass -T error.log "https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/$(date '+%d-%b-%Y')/error.log"
----

To move a file:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -u user:pass -X MOVE --header 'Destination: https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/target.jpg' https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/source.jpg
----

To get the properties of files in the root folder:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X PROPFIND -H "Depth: 1" -u user:pass https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav/files/USERNAME/ | xml_pp
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

  </d:response>
</d:multistatus>
----

To get the file id of a file, regardless of location, you need to make a
PROPFIND request. This request requires two things:

1.  A PROPFIND XML element in the body of the request method.
2.  The path to the file that you want to find out more about

Here’s an example PROPFIND XML element, which we’ll store as
`propfind-fileid.xml`.

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<a:propfind xmlns:a="DAV:" xmlns:oc="http://owncloud.org/ns">
    <!-- retrieve the file's id -->
    <a:prop><oc:fileid/></a:prop>
</a:propfind>
----

NOTE: You could pass this directly to the Curl request. However, it can often be easier to create, maintain, and to share, if it’s created in a standalone file.

With the file created, make the request by running the following Curl
command:

[source,xml]
----
curl -u username:password -X PROPFIND \
  -H "Content-Type: text/xml" \
  --data-binary "@propfind-fileid.xml" \
  'http://localhost/remote.php/dav/files/admin/Photos/San%20Francisco.jpg'
----

This will return an XML response payload similar to the following
example. It contains the relative path to the file and the fileid of the
file.

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<d:multistatus xmlns:d="DAV:" xmlns:s="http://sabredav.org/ns" xmlns:cal="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" xmlns:cs="http://calendarserver.org/ns/" xmlns:card="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:carddav" xmlns:oc="http://owncloud.org/ns">
  <d:response>
    <d:href>/remote.php/dav/files/admin/Photos/San%20Francisco.jpg</d:href>
    <d:propstat>
      <d:prop>
        <oc:fileid>4</oc:fileid>
      </d:prop>
      <d:status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</d:status>
    </d:propstat>
  </d:response>
</d:multistatus>
----

NOTE: The example above’s been formatted for readability, using http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Format_your_xml_document_using_xmllint[xmllint], which is part of libxml2. To format it as it is listed above, pipe the previous command to `xmllint --format -`.
