Manage Connected Browsers and Devices
=====================================

The personal settings page allows you to have an overview on the
connected browsers and devices.

Managing Connected Browsers

In the list of connected browsers you see which browsers connected to
your account recently:

You can use the trash icon to disconnect any of the browsers in the
list.

Managing Devices
----------------

In the list of connected devices you see all the devices and clients you
generated a device password for and their last activity:

You can use the trash icon to disconnect any of the devices in the list.

At the bottom of the list you find a button to create a new
device-specific password. You can choose a name to identify the token
later. The generated password is used for configuring the new client.
Ideally, generate individual tokens for every device you connect to your
account, so you can disconnect those individually if necessary.

You have only access to the device password when creating it, ownCloud
will not save the plain password, hence itâ€™s recommended to enter the
password on the new client immediately.

If two-factor authentication is enabled for your account,
device-specific passwords are the only way to configure clients. The
client will deny connections of clients using your login password then.
