Thunderbird - Synchronize Addressbook
=====================================

As someone who is new to ownCloud, New to SoGo Connector, and new to
Thunderbird Addressbook, here is what you need in excruciating pithy
detail to make this work (for all the other lost souls out there):

1.  http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/[Thunderbird] for your OS
unless it comes with your OS distribution (Linux)
2.  http://www.sogo.nu/downloads/frontends.html[Sogo Connector] (latest
release)
3.  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/lightning/[Lightning]
(a Thunderbird calendar add-on. At the time (Aug 14), syncing your
contacts only works with this add-on installed.)

With an installed Thunderbird mail tool, an installed SoGo Connector, and
an installed Lightning add-on:

1.  Thunderbird Addressbook is in the Thunderbird "Tools" Menu
2.  In the Thunderbird Addressbook application:
* ``File > New > *Remote Addressbook*'' (SoGo Connector added this)
* ``**Name:**'' is the name you want to give your Addressbook in the
Thunderbird addressbook bar area
* ``**URL:**'' is found in your ownCloud Contacts area, that little Gear
symbol

in the -bottom left- of the Contacts View (same symbol as found in the
-top right- in the Calendar view). Then look for a little impeller
symbol

which will display the URL you need for your installation to work.

Once installed, synchronize (right click on your newly made remote
address book and select "Synchronize"). You’ll see your address book
populate from ownCloud! Don’t click ``read only'' above unless you don’t
want to modify your ownCloud server addressbook, like it contains a
listing of corporate contacts and is shared with lots of people, and you
don’t want a new user dragging it somewhere unintended.

The rest of the details of dealing with Thunderbird addressbook are left
to the reader… First thing I learned is dragging a contact to a
different addressbook is a move operation. If you are worried about
losing the contact, save it to a VCF file using ownCloud (Or LDIF using
Thunderbird Addressbook) first! Like dragging from ``ownCloud
Addressbook'' to ``Personal Address Book'' removes the contact from
ownCloud Server (_deleting it from all the other synchronized
installations_) and puts it in your Local Machine -only-Address Book. So
be careful or you’ll have unintended consequences where you might have
intended a copy operation.

Contact _Pictures_ are also sync’ed!
