Using the Calendar App
======================

The Calendar app is not enabled by default in ownCloud and needs to be
enabled separately. It is also not a supported core app. It is currently
under heavy development, so documentation has moved to the
link:[documentation Wiki on Github
<https://github.com/owncloud/documentation/wiki/Using-the-Calendar-App-in-
ownCloud-9.0>]. You are welcome to add content to the Wiki document; all
you need is a Github account.
