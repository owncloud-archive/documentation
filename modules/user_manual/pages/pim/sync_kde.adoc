Synchronizing with KDE SC
=========================

From KDE SC 4.8 and forward setting up ownCloud is very easy. Note that
the KDE calendar needs to have the ownCloud Calendar and Contacts apps
enabled on the ownCloud server. You need both and not just the Calendar.
From System Settings Personal Information/Akonadi Resources
Configuration select DAV Groupware resource.

Enter your ownCloud username and password and click ``Next''.

Select ownCloud in the drop down list and click ``Next''.

Enter the host name and installation path. If you do not use SSL
remember to de-select ``Use secure connection''.

Test the connection. If everything went well you should see a message
like the one below.

Click ``Finish'' and you will be able to change the display name and
refresh interval.

Now you should see the Akonadi resource doing the first synchronization.

You can find the Contacts and Calendars in Kontact (or
KOrganizer/KAddressbook if you run the programs separately.)
