Configuring External Storage
============================

The External Storage application allows you to mount external storage
services, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3, SMB/CIFS
fileservers, and FTP servers in ownCloud. Your ownCloud server
administrator controls which of these are available to you. Please see
link:[Configuring External Storage (GUI)
<https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/files/
external_storage_configuration_gui.html>] in the ownCloud
Administratorâ€™s manual for configuration howtos and examples.
