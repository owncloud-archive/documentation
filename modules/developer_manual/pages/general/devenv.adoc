Development Environment
=======================

To be able to use and develop with ownCloud takes a few steps.

1.  Install the Core Software
2.  Setup the web server and database
3.  Get the source
4.  Install software dependencies
5.  Enable debug mode
6.  Setup ownCloud

If you have already completed one or more of these steps, feel free to
skip them. Otherwise, if you’re just getting started, begin by getting
the ownCloud source code.

[[install-the-core-software]]
Install the Core Software
-------------------------

The first thing to do is to ensure that your server has the necessary
software for installing and running ownCloud. While you can go further,
you need to install at least the following:

* https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[Make]
* https://nodejs.org[Node.js].
* https://git-scm.com/[git]
* https://www.npmjs.com/[npm]
* https://linux.die.net/man/1/unzip[unzip]
* https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/[wget]

# Ensure that Apt's cache is up to date
sudo apt-get -y -q update

# Auto-install the required dependencies with a minimum of output
sudo apt-get install -y -q wget make npm nodejs unzip git

....

[[setup-the-webserver-and-database]]
Setup the Webserver and Database
--------------------------------

Next, you need to setup your web and database servers, so that they work
properly with ownCloud. The respective guides are available at:

* https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#apache-configuration-label[Apache
Webserver Configuration]
* https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.html[Database
Server Configuration]

[[get-the-source]]
Get The Source
--------------

With the web and database servers setup, you next need to get a copy of
ownCloud. There are two ways to do so:

1.  Use
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/#installation[the
stable version]
2.  Clone the development version from
https://github.com/owncloud[GitHub]:

For the sake of a brief example, assuming you chose to clone from
GitHub, here’s an example of how to do so:

....
# Assuming that /var/www/html is the webserver's document root
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/core.git /var/www/html/core
....

*What is the Web Server’s Root Directory?*

The quickest way to find out is by using the `ls` command, for example:
`ls -lah /var/wwww`. Depending on your Linux distribution, it’s likely
to be one of `/var/www`, `/var/www/html`, or `/srv/http`.

[[set-user-group-and-permissions]]
Set User, Group, and Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You now need to make sure that the web server user (and optionally the
web server’s group) have read/write access to the directory where you
installed ownCloud: The following commands assume that `/var/www` is the
web server’s directory and that `www-data` is the web server user and
group. The following commands will do this:

....
# Set the user and group to the webserver user and group
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/core/

# Set read/write permissions on the directory
sudo chmod o+rw /var/www/html/core/
....

*What is the Web Server’s User and Group?*

There are a few ways to identify the user and group the webserver is
running as. Likely the easiest are `grep` and `ps`. Here’s an example of
using both (which assumes that the distribution is Ubuntu 16.04).

....
# Find the user defined in Apache's configuration files
grep -r 'APACHE_RUN_USER' /etc/apache2/

# Find the user that's running Apache.
ps -aux | grep apache2
....

___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Depending on your distribution, it will likely be one of `http`,
`www-data`, `apache`, or `wwwrun`.

[[install-software-dependencies]]
Install Software Dependencies
-----------------------------

With the ownCloud source
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#configure-the-apache-web-server[available
to your webserver], next install ownCloud’s dependencies by running
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[Make], from the directory where
ownCloud’s located. Here’s an example of how to do so:

[source,console]
----
# Assuming that the ownCloud source is located in ``/var/www/html/core`` 
cd /var/www/html/core && make
----

By default, running `make` will install the required dependencies for
both PHP and JavaScript. However, there are other options that it
supports, which you can see in the table below, which are useful for a
variety of tasks.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Target |Description
|make |Pulls in both Composer and Bower dependencies

|make clean |Cleans up dependencies. This is useful for starting over or

| |when switching to older branches

|make dist |Builds a minimal owncloud-core tarball with only core apps

| |in build/dist/core, stripped of unwanted files

|make docs |Builds the JavaScript documentation using
http://usejsdoc.org[JSDoc]

|make test |Runs all of the test targets

|make test-external |Runs one of the external storage tests, and is
configurable

| |through make variables

|make test-js |Runs the Javascript unit tests, replacing
./autotest-js.sh

|make test-php |Runs the PHPUnit tests with SQLite as the data source.
This

| |replaces ./autotest.sh sqlite and is configurable through

| |make variables
|=======================================================================

[[enable-debug-mode]]
Enable Debug Mode
-----------------

Now that ownCloud’s available to your web server and the dependencies
are installed, we strongly encourage you to disable JavaScript and CSS
caching during development. This is so that when changes are made,
they’re immediately visible, not at some later stage when the respective
caches expire. To do so, enable debug mode by setting `debug` to `true`
in config/config.php, as in the example below.

[source,php]
----
<?php

$CONFIG = [
    'debug' => true,
    ... configuration goes here ...
];
----

Do not enable this for production! This can create security problems and
is only meant for debugging and development!

[[setup-owncloud]]
Setup ownCloud
--------------

With all that done, you’re now ready to use either
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/installation_wizard.html[the
installation wizard] or
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/command_line_installation.html[command
line installer] to finish setting up ownCloud.
