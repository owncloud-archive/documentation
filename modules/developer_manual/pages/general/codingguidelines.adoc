Coding Style & General Guidelines
=================================

[[coding]]
Coding
------

* Maximum line-length of 80 characters
* Use tabs to indent
* A tab is 4 spaces wide
* Opening braces of blocks are on the same line as the definition
* Quotes: ’ for everything, " for HTML attributes (<p
class=``my_class`>)
* End of Lines : Unix style (LF / `n') only
* No global variables or functions
* Unit tests
* HTML should be HTML5 compliant
* Check these

performance tips]
* When you `git pull`, always `git pull --rebase` to avoid generating
extra commits like: _merged master into master_

[[css]]
CSS

Take a look at the http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou2wJCh3XE&feature=plcp[Writing Tactical CSS & HTML] video on YouTube.

Don’t bind your CSS too much to your HTML structure and try to avoid
IDs. Also try to make your CSS reusable by grouping common attributes
into classes.

*DO*:

[source,css]
----
.list {
    list-style-type: none;
}

.list > .list_item {
    display: inline-block;
}

.important_list_item {
    color: red;
}
----

*DON’T*:

[source,css]
----
#content .myHeader ul {
    list-style-type: none;
}

#content .myHeader ul li.list_item {
    color: red;
    display: inline-block;
}
----

[[general]]
General
-------

* Ideally, discuss your plans on the
https://mailman.owncloud.org/mailman/listinfo/devel[mailing list] to see
if others want to work with you on it
* We use https://github.com/owncloud[Github], please get an account
there and clone the repositories you want to work on
* Fixes go directly to master, nevertheless they need to be tested
thoroughly.
* New features are always developed in a branch and only merged to
master once they are fully done.
* Software should work. We only put features into master when they are
complete. It’s better to not have a feature instead of having one that
works poorly.
* It is best to start working based on an issue - create one if there is
none. You describe what you want to do, ask feedback on the direction
you take it and take it from there.
* When you are finished, use the merge request function on Github to
create a pull request. The other developers will look at it and give you
feedback. You can signify that your PR is ready for review by adding the
label ``5 - ready for review` to it. You can also post your merge
request to the mailing list to let people know. See
the code review page for more information <../bugtracker/codereviews>
* It is essential to keep changes small and separate. The bigger a PR
grows, the harder it is to complete a quick and efficient review. Given
that, split larger changes up into smaller changes, where you can. For
example, if you need a minor improvement, get it in first rather than
adding it as part of a much larger piece of work.
* Decisions are made by consensus. We strive for making the best
technical decisions and as nobody can know everything, we collaborate.
That means a first negative comment might not be the final word, neither
is positive feedback an immediate GO. ownCloud is built out of modular
pieces (apps) and maintainers have a strong influence. In case of
disagreement we consult other seasoned contributors.

[[labels]]
Labels
------

We assign labels to issues and pull requests to make it easier to find
them as well as to signal what needs to be done with them. Some of these
are assigned by the developers, others by QA, bug triggers, project lead
or maintainers and so on. It is not desired that users/reporters of bugs
assign labels themselves, unless they are developers/contributors to
ownCloud.

The most important labels and their meaning:

* #bug - this issue is a bug
* #enhancement - this issue is a feature request/idea for improvement of
ownCloud
* #design - this needs help from the design team or is a design-related
issue/pull request
* #sharing - this issue or PR is related to sharing
* #technical debt - this issue or PR is about
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt[technical debt]
* #sev1-critical #sev2-high #sev3-medium #sev4-low signify how important
the bug is.
* #p1-urgent #p2-high #p3-medium #p4-low signify the priority of the
bug.
* #Junior Job - these are issues which are relatively easy to solve and
ideal for people who want to learn how to code in ownCloud
* Tags showing the state of the issue or PR, numbered 1-6:

______________________________________________________________________________
* #1 - To develop - ready to start development on this
* #2 - Developing - development in progress
* #3 - To Review - ready for review
* #4 - To Release - reviewed PR that awaits unfreeze of a branch to get
merged
______________________________________________________________________________

* App tags: #app:files #app:user_ldap #app:files_versions and so on.
These tags indicate the app that is impacted by the issue or which the
PR is related to
* Settings tags: #settings:personal #settings:apps #settings:admin and
so on. These tags indicate the settings area that is impacted by the
issue or which the PR is related to
* db tags: #db:mysql #db:sqlite #db:postgresql and so on. These tags
indicate the database that is impacted by the issue or which the PR is
related to
* Browser tags: #browser:ie #browser:safari and so on. These tags
indicate the browser that is impacted by the issue or which the PR is
related to
* Component tags: #comp:filesystem #comp:javascript and so on. These
tags indicate the components of ownCloud impacted by the issue or which
the PR is related to
* Development tool tags: #dev:unit_testing #dev:public_API and so on.
These tags indicate development-specific tools like those for testing
and public developer-facing API’s impacted by the issue or which the PR
is related
* Feature tags: #feature:something. These tags indicate the features
across apps and components which are impacted by the issue or which the
PR is related to
* #triage - this issue _has to be_ triaged <../bugtracker/triaging>
* #needs info - this issue needs further information from the reporter,
see triaging <../bugtracker/triaging> old tag is #clarification request,
please don’t use that one anymore.
* #discussion - this issue needs to be discussed
* #security - this is a security related issue
* #windows server - this is related to windows server
* #research - this item requires some research before it can continue
* #packaging - this is related to packaging
* #theming - refers to theming issues or improvements
* #l10n - refers to translation issues or improvements
* #release note - relevant for the release notes
* #privacy - refers to issues that might lead to privacy concerns
* #won’t fix - This problem won’t be fixed (can be for a wide variety of
reasons…)

[[severity-level-labels]]
Severity Level Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To better understand which severity level to apply, if any, here is a
description of each of the four severity labels.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Label |Description
|#sev1-critical |The operation is in production and is mission critical
to the

| |business. The product is inoperable and the situation is

| |resulting in a total disruption of work. There is no workaround

| |available.

|#sev2-high |Operations are severely restricted. Important features are

| |unavailable, although work can continue in a limited fashion.

| |A workaround is available.

|#sev3-medium |The product does not work as designed resulting in a
minor loss

| |of usage. A workaround is available.

|#sev4-low |There is no loss of service. This may be a request for

| |documentation, general information, product enhancement request,

| |etc.
|=======================================================================

[[dont-see-the-label-you-need]]
Don’t See The Label You Need?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want a label not in the list above, please first discuss on the
mailing list.

[[javascript]]
JavaScript
----------

In general take a look at http://www.jslint.com/[JSLint] without the
whitespace rules.

* Use a js/main.js or js/app.js where your program is started
* Complete every statement with a *;*
* Use *var* to limit variable to local scope
* To keep your code local, wrap everything in a self executing function.
To access global objects or export things to the global namespace, pass
all global objects to the self executing function.
* Use JavaScript strict mode
* Use a global namespace object where you bind publicly used functions
and objects to

*DO*:

[source,javascript]
----
// set up namespace for sharing across multiple files
var MyApp = MyApp || {};

(function(window, $, exports, undefined) {
    'use strict';

    // if this function or object should be global, attach it to the namespace
    exports.myGlobalFunction = function(params) {
        return params;
    };

})(window, jQuery, MyApp);
----

*DONT* (Seriously):

[source,javascript]
----
// This does not only make everything global but you're programming
// JavaScript like C functions with namespaces
MyApp = {
    myFunction:function(params) {
        return params;
    },
    ...
};
----

[[objects-inheritance]]
Objects & Inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try to use OOP in your JavaScript to make your code reusable and
flexible.

This is how you’d do inheritance in JavaScript:

[source,javascript]
----
// create parent object and bind methods to it
var ParentObject = function(name) {
    this.name = name;
};

ParentObject.prototype.sayHello = function() {
    console.log(this.name);
}


// create childobject, call parents constructor and inherit methods
var ChildObject = function(name, age) {
    ParentObject.call(this, name);
    this.age = age;
};

ChildObject.prototype = Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);

// overwrite parent method
ChildObject.prototype.sayHello = function() {
    // call parent method if you want to
    ParentObject.prototype.sayHello.call(this);
    console.log('childobject');
};

var child = new ChildObject('toni', 23);

// prints:
// toni
// childobject
child.sayHello();
----

[[objects-functions-variables]]
Objects, Functions & Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use Pascal case for Objects, Camel case for functions and variables.

[source,javascript]
----
var MyObject = function() {
    this.attr = "hi";
};

var myFunction = function() {
    return true;
};

var myVariable = 'blue';

var objectLiteral = {
    value1: 'somevalue'
};
----

[[operators]]
Operators
~~~~~~~~~

Use *===* and *!==* instead of *==* and *!=*.

Here’s why:

[source,javascript]
----
` == '0'           // false
0 == `             // true
0 == '0'            // true

false == 'false'    // false
false == '0'        // true

false == undefined  // false
false == null       // false
null == undefined   // true

' \t\r\n ' == 0     // true
----

[[control-structures]]
Control Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Always use \{ } for one line ifs
* Split long ifs into multiple lines
* Always use break in switch statements and prevent a default block with
warnings if it shouldn’t be accessed

*DO*:

[source,javascript]
----
// single line if
if (myVar === 'hi') {
    myVar = 'ho';
} else {
    myVar = 'bye';
}

// long ifs
if (   something === 'something'
    || condition2
    && condition3
) {
  // your code
}

// for loop
for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    // your code
}

// switch
switch (value) {

    case 'hi':
        // yourcode
        break;

    default:
        console.warn('Entered undefined default block in switch');
        break;
}
----

[[php]]
PHP
---

The ownCloud coding style guide is based on
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php[PEAR Coding Standards]. To
check your PHP codestyle use
https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer[PHP Code Sniffer] >= 3.0
with the `phpcs.xml` config file from the core branch.

To check one file use: `phpcs --standard=./phpcs.xml yourCode.php`

To check all files in a folder (recursive) use:
`phpcs --standard=./phpcs.xml your/code/folder/`

A https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks[git
pre-commit hook] is available
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ikke/git-precommit-phpcs/master/pre-commit[here].
Download and save the file in the `.git/hooks` folder of your owncloud
project and change the `PHPCS_STANDARD` constant to the path of the
`phpcs.xml` file.

[[start-closing]]
Start & closing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Always use:

....
<?php
....

at the start of your php code. The final closing:

....
?>
....

should not be used at the end of the file due to the
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4410704/php-closing-tag[possible
issue of sending white spaces].

[[comments]]
Comments
~~~~~~~~

All API methods need to be marked with
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc[PHPDoc] markup. An example would be:

[source,php]
----
<?php

/**
 * Description what method does
 * @param Controller $controller the controller that will be transformed
 * @param API $api an instance of the API class
 * @throws APIException if the api is broken
 * @since 4.5
 * @return string a name of a user
 */
public function myMethod(Controller $controller, API $api) {
  // ...
}
----

[[objects-functions-arrays-variables]]
Objects, Functions, Arrays & Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use Pascal case for Objects, Camel case for functions and variables. If
you set a default function/method parameter, do not use spaces. Do not
prepend private class members with underscores.

[source,javascript]
----
class MyClass {

}

function myFunction($default=null) {

}

$myVariable = 'blue';

$someArray = array(
    'foo'  => 'bar',
    'spam' => 'ham',
);

?>
----

[[operators-1]]
Operators
~~~~~~~~~

Use *===* and *!==* instead of *==* and *!=*.

Here’s why:

[source,php]
----
<?php

var_dump(0 == "a"); // 0 == 0 -> true
var_dump("1" == "01"); // 1 == 1 -> true
var_dump("10" == "1e1"); // 10 == 10 -> true
var_dump(100 == "1e2"); // 100 == 100 -> true

?>
----

[[control-structures-1]]
Control Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Always use \{ } for one line ifs
* Split long ifs into multiple lines
* Always use break in switch statements and prevent a default block with
warnings if it shouldn’t be accessed

[source,php]
----
<?php

// single line if
if ($myVar === 'hi') {
    $myVar = 'ho';
} else {
    $myVar = 'bye';
}

// long ifs
if (   $something === 'something'
    || $condition2
    && $condition3
) {
  // your code
}

// for loop
for ($i = 0; $i < 4; $i++) {
    // your code
}

switch ($condition) {
    case 1:
        // action1
        break;

    case 2:
        // action2;
        break;

    default:
        // defaultaction;
        break;
}

?>
----

[[unit-tests]]
Unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~

Unit tests must always extend the `\Test\TestCase` class, which takes
care of cleaning up the installation after the test.

If a test is run with multiple different values, a data provider must be
used. The name of the data provider method must not start with `test`
and must end with `Data`.

[source,php]
----
<?php
namespace Test;
class Dummy extends \Test\TestCase {
    public function dummyData() {
        return array(
            array(1, true),
            array(2, false),
        );
    }

    /**
     * @dataProvider dummyData
     */
    public function testDummy($input, $expected) {
        $this->assertEquals($expected, \Dummy::method($input));
    }
}
----

[[user-interface]]
User Interface
--------------

* Software should not get in the way of what the user needs to do. It
should do as much as possible automatically, instead of offering
configuration options for the user to chose from.
* Software should be easy to use. Show only the most important elements.
Secondary elements should only appear as a result of a hovering the
mouse over an element, or via choosing advanced functionality.
* User data is sacred. Provide undo instead of asking for confirmation -
http://www.alistapart.com/articles/neveruseawarning/[which might be
dismissed]
* The state of the application should be clear. If something loads,
provide feedback.
* Do not adapt broken concepts (for example design of desktop apps) just
for the sake of consistency. We aim to provide a better interface, so
let’s find out how to do that!
* Regularly reset your installation to see what the first-run experience
looks like — then improve it!
* Ideally do
http://jancborchardt.net/usability-in-free-software[usability testing]
to know how people use the software.
* For further UX principles, read
http://uxmag.com/articles/quantifying-usability[Alex Faaborg from
Mozilla].
