Backporting
===========

[[general]]
General
-------

We backport important fixes and improvements from the current master
release to get them to our users faster.

Process
-------

We mostly consider bug fixes for back porting. Occasionally, important
changes to the API can be backported to make it easier for developers to
keep their apps working between major releases. If you think a pull
request (PR) is relevant for the stable release, go through these steps:

1.  Make sure the PR is merged to master
2.  Ask the feature maintainer if the code should be backported and add
the label
https://github.com/owncloud/core/labels/Backport-Request[backport-request]
to the PR
3.  If the maintainer say yes then create a new branch based on the
respective stable branch, cherry-pick the needed commits to that branch
and create a PR on GitHub.
4.  Specify the corresponding milestone for that series to this PR and
reference the original PR in there. This enables the QA team to find the
backported items for testing and having the original PR with detailed
description linked.

Before each patch release there is a freeze to be able to test
everything as a whole without pulling in new changes. This freeze is
announced on the
https://mailman.owncloud.org/pipermail/devel/[owncloud-devel
mailinglist]. While this freeze is active a backport isn’t allowed and
has to wait for the next patch release.

The QA team will try to reproduce all the issues with the
X.Y.Z-next-maintenance milestone on the relevant release and verify it
is fixed by the patch release (and doesn’t cause new problems). Once the
patch release is out, the post-fix -next-maintenance is removed and a
new -next-maintenance milestone is created for that series.

[[steps]]
Steps
-----

Because pushing directly to particular ownCloud branches is forbidden
(e.g., `origin/stable-xx`), you need to create your own remote branch,
based off of the branch that you wish to backport to. However, doing so
can involve a number of manual steps. To reduce the effort and time
involved, use the script below instead.

[source,console]
----
#!/bin/bash
set -e

if [ "$#" -lt 2 ]; then
    echo "Illegal number of parameters"
    echo "  $0 <commit-sha> <targetBranchName>"
    echo "  For example: $0 123456789 stable10"
    exit
fi

commit=$1
targetBranch=$2
echo "backporting $commit to $targetBranch"

git fetch -p
git checkout $targetBranch
git pull --rebase
git checkout -b $targetBranch-$commit
git cherry-pick $commit || git cherry-pick -m 1 $commit

message=`git log -1 --pretty=%B`
git commit --amend -m "[$targetBranch] $message"
git push origin $targetBranch-$commit
----

Assuming that you store the script in a file called `backport.sh`, the
command would be called as follows:

[source,console]
----
./backport.sh 123456 stable10
----

When doing this yourself, remember to adapt the commit hash and the
target branch accordingly.

When the script completes, go to GitHub, where it will suggest that you
make a PR from pushed branch. Change the base branch to be committed
against, from `master` to `stable10` and continue.

In case you have installed the `xdg-utils` package, you can add at the
end of the script above following code which opens the PR to be
finalized in your browser:

[source,console]
----
repo=`git remote -v | grep -m 1 "(push)" | sed -e "s/.*github.com[:/]\(.*\)\.git.*/\1/"`
branch=`git name-rev --name-only HEAD`
echo "Creating pull request for branch \"$branch\" in \"$repo\""

xdg-open "https://github.com/$repo/pull/new/$targetBranch...$branch"
