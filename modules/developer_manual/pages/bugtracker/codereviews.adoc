[[introduction]]
Introduction
------------

In order to increase the code quality within ownCloud, developers are
requested to perform code reviews. As we are now heavily using the
GitHub platform these code review shall take place on GitHub as well.

Precondition
------------

From now on no direct commits/pushes to master or any of the stable
branches are allowed in general. *Every code* change - *even one liners*
- have to be reviewed!

[[how-will-it-work]]
How will it work?
-----------------

1.  A developer will submit his changes on GitHub via a pull request
(PR). https://help.GitHub.com/articles/using-pull-requests[GitHub:help -
using pull requests]
2.  Within the pull request the developer could already name other
developers (using
+
@GitHubusername) and ask them for review.
3.  Using Labels section on the right side, they add _``3 - To review`_
label if the patch is complete. If they have no permission to do that,
other developers may add this Label in case PR author had indicated.
4.  Other developers (either named or at free will) have a look at the
changes and are welcome to write comments within the comment field.
5.  In case the reviewer is okay with the changes and thinks all his
comments and suggestions have been take into account a :+1 on the
comment will signal a positive review.
6.  Before a pull request will be merged into master or the
corresponding branch at least 2 reviewers need to give :+1 score.
7.  Our https://ci.owncloud.org/[continuous integration server] will
give an additional indicator for the quality of the pull request.

Read our coding_style_guidelines_label for information on what a good
pull request and good ownCloud code looks like.

These are two examples that are considered to be good examples of how
pull requests should be handled
