Code Signing
============

ownCloud supports code signing for the core releases, and for ownCloud
applications. Code signing gives our users an additional layer of
security by ensuring that nobody other than authorized individuals can
push updates.

It also ensures that all upgrades have been executed properly, so that
no files are left behind, and all old files are properly replaced. In
the past, invalid updates were a significant source of errors when
updating ownCloud.

[[why-did-owncloud-add-code-signing]]
Why Did ownCloud Add Code Signing?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By supporting Code Signing we add another layer of security which
ensures that nobody, other than authorized individuals, can push updates
for applications. This ensures proper upgrades.

[[do-we-lock-down-owncloud]]
Do We Lock Down ownCloud?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ownCloud project is open source and always will be. We do not want
to make it more difficult for our users to run ownCloud. Any code
signing errors on upgrades will not prevent ownCloud from running, but
will display a warning on the Admin page. For applications that are not
tagged ``Official` the code signing process is optional.

[[is-owncloud-not-open-source-anymore]]
Is ownCloud Not Open Source Anymore?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ownCloud project is open source and always will be. The code signing
process is optional, though highly recommended. The code check for the
core parts of ownCloud is enabled when the ownCloud release version
branch has been set to stable.

For custom distributions of ownCloud it is recommended to change the
release version branch in version.php to something else than ``stable`.

[[is-code-signing-mandatory-for-apps]]
Is Code Signing Mandatory For Apps?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Code signing is optional for all third-party applications. Applications
with a tag of ``Official` on https://marketplace.owncloud.com/ require
code signing.

[[technical-details]]
Technical details
-----------------

ownCloud uses a X.509 based approach to handle authentication of code.
Each ownCloud release contains the certificate of a shipped ownCloud
Code Signing Root Authority. The private key of this certificate is only
accessible to the project leader, who may grant trusted project members
with a copy of this private key.

This Root Authority is only used for signing certificate signing
requests (CSRs) for additional certificates. Certificates issued by the
Root Authority must always to be limited to a specific scope, usually
the application identifier. This enforcement is done using the `CN`
attribute of the certificate.

Code signing is then done by creating a `signature.json` file with the
following content:

*hashes*: This is an array of all files in the folder with their
corresponding SHA-512 hashes.

*certificate*: This is the certificate used for signing.

* It has to be issued by the ownCloud Root Authority
* Its CN needs to be permitted to perform the required action.

*signature*: This is a signature of the hashes which can be verified
using the certificate. Having the certificate bundled within the
`signature.json` file has the advantage that even if a developer loses
their certificate, future updates can still be ensured by having a new
certificate issued.

[[how-code-signing-affects-apps-in-the-owncloud-marketplace]]
How Code Signing Affects Apps in the ownCloud Marketplace
---------------------------------------------------------

* Unsigned apps can’t be uploaded to the marketplace. They can be
installed manually, but the warning: `"Integrity check failed"`, will
always be visible.
* Apps which have been signed in a previous release *MUST* be
code-signed in all future releases as well, otherwise the update will be
refused.

[[how-to-get-your-app-signed]]
How to Get Your App Signed
--------------------------

The following commands require that you have OpenSSL installed on your
machine. Ensure that you keep all generated files to sign your
application. The following examples will assume that you are trying to
sign an application named *``contacts`*.

Firstly, generate a private key and CSR. This can be done with the
following command.

....
# Replace "contacts" with your application identifier.
openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout contacts.key -out contacts.csr -subj "/CN=contacts"
....

Then, post the CSR on https://github.com/owncloud/appstore-issues, and
configure your GitHub account to show your mail address in your profile.
ownCloud might ask you for further information to verify that you’re the
legitimate owner of the application. Make sure to keep the private key
file (`contacts.key`) secret and not disclose it to any third-parties.

ownCloud will then provide you with the signed certificate.

Finally, run `./occ integrity:sign-app` to sign your application, and
specify your private and the public key as well as the path to the
application. A valid example looks like:

....
./occ integrity:sign-app --privateKey=/Users/lukasreschke/contacts.key --certificate=/Users/lukasreschke/CA/contacts.crt --path=/Users/lukasreschke/Programming/contacts``
....

The occ tool will store a `signature.json` file within the `appinfo`
folder of your application. Then compress the application folder, naming
it `contacts.tar.gz`, and upload it to
https://marketplace.owncloud.com/. Be aware that making any changes to
the application, after it has been signed, requires it to be signed
again. So if you do not want to have some files shipped remove them
before running the signing command.

In case you lose your certificate please submit a new CSR as described
above and mention that you have lost the previous one. ownCloud will
revoke the old certificate.

If you maintain an app together with multiple people it is recommended
to designate a release manager responsible for the signing process as
well as the uploading to https://marketplace.owncloud.com/[marketplace].
If case this is not feasible, and multiple certificates are required,
ownCloud can create them on a case by case basis. We do not recommend
developers to share their private key.

[[errors]]
Errors
------

The following errors can be encountered when trying to verify a code
signature. For information about how to get access to those results
please refer to
https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/issues/code_signing.html#fixing-invalid-code-integrity-messages[the
Issues section of the ownCloud Server Administration manual].

`INVALID_HASH`

* The file has a different hash than specified within `signature.json`.
This usually happens when the file has been modified after writing the
signature data.

`MISSING_FILE`

* The file cannot be found but has been specified within
`signature.json`. Either a required file has been left out, or
`signature.json` needs to be edited.

`EXTRA_FILE`

* The file does not exist in `signature.json`. This usually happens when
a file has been removed and `signature.json` has not been updated.

`EXCEPTION`

* Another exception has prevented the code verification. There are
currently these following exceptions:
** `Signature data not found.`
*** The app has mandatory code signing enforced but no `signature.json`
file has been found in its `appinfo` folder.
** `Certificate is not valid.`
*** The certificate has not been issued by the official ownCloud Code
Signing Root Authority.
** `Certificate is not valid for required scope. (Requested: %s, current:  %s)`
*** The certificate is not valid for the defined application.
Certificates are only valid for the defined app identifier and cannot be
used for others.
** `Signature could not get verified.`
*** There was a problem with verifying the signature of
`signature.json`.
