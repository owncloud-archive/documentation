Create Custom Storage Backends
==============================

The preferred way for applications to create new storage backends is to
create a subclass of `\OC\Files\Storage\Common` and implement the
abstract methods. It’s also possible to create storage backends by
implementing the required interface.

However, by sub-classing the common backend a lot of the boiler plate is
taken care of. What’s more, it provides common implementations and
fallbacks to reduce the amount of work it is to create a storage
backend.

[[required-methods]]
Required Methods
----------------

All storage backends sub-classing the common storage backend must
implement the following methods:

[width="100%",cols="36%,64%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Method |Description
|`mkdir($path)` |Creates a new folder on the storage.

|`rmdir($path)` |Deletes an existing folder on the storage.

|`opendir($path)` |Opens a directory handle.

|`stat($path)` |Retrieves the metadata for the file or folder. The
returned array should, at least, contain `mtime` and `size`.

|`filetype($path)` |Returns the file type; either `file` or `dir`.

|`file_exists($path)` |Checks if a file or folder exists.

|`unlink($path)` |Removes a file or folder. This isn’t only for deleting
files, unlike PHP’s unlink method.

|`fopen($path, $mode)` |Opens a file handle for a file

|`touch($path, $mtime = null)` |Updates the mtime of a file or folder.
If `$mtime` is omitted the current time should be used.
|=======================================================================

[[suggested-methods]]
Suggested Methods
-----------------

The common storage backends provide fallback implementations for a
number of methods to make them easier to implement. However, some of
fallback implementations are either inefficient or don’t always provide
the correct result for custom storage backends. Given that, please
consider overriding one or more of the following methods:

[width="100%",cols="39%,61%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Method |Description
|`rename($sourcePath, $targetPath)` |Renames a file. The default
implementation uses `copy` and `unlink` which is very inefficient.

|`copy($sourcePath, $targetPath)` |Copies a file. The default
implementation copies using streams. This is inefficient for remote
storages as it downloads and re-uploads the file.

|`isReadable($path)` |Checks if a file is readable. It defaults to
`true` if the file exists.

|`isUpdatable($path)` |Checks if a file or folder can be updated. This
includes being written to or renamed. It defaults to `true` if the file
exists.

|`isCreatable($path)` |Checks if new files can be created in a folder It
defaults to `isUpdatable($path)`.

|`isDeletable($path)` |Checks if a file can be deleted. It defaults to
`isUpdatable($path)`.

|`isSharable($path)` |Checks if a file can be shared. It defaults to
`isReadable($path)`.

|`free_space($path)` |Checks the free space on the storage in bits.
|=======================================================================

[[other-useful-methods]]
Other Useful Methods
--------------------

The default implementation for the following methods are good for most
storage backends. But, providing an alternate implementation _can_
improve user experience.

[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Method |Description
|`file_put_contents($path, $data)` |Stores a file on the storage. It
defaults to using `fopen($path, 'w')`.

|`file_get_contents($path)` |Retrieves a file from storage. Defaults to
using `fopen($path, 'r')`.

|`getMimeType($path)` |Retrieves the mimetype of a file or folder.
Defaults to guessing the mimetype from the extension. The mimetype of a
folder is _link:[required] to be `'httpd/unix-directory'`.

|`hasUpdated($path, $time)` |Checks if a file or folder has been updated
since `$time`. If you’re certain the files on the storage will not be
updated outside of ownCloud you can always return `false` to increase
performance.

|`getETag($path)` |Retrieves the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag[Etag] for a file or folder.

|`verifyPath($path, $fileName)` |Checks if a filename is valid for the
storage backend. It defaults to checking for invalid characters or names
for the server platform.

[[copying-and-moving-between-storage-backends]]
Copying and Moving Between Storage Backends
-------------------------------------------

When copying or moving files between different storages a stream copy is
used by default. This works well for copying between different types of
storages, such as from local to SMB. But, there are cases where a more
efficient copy is possible, such as between two SMB storages on the same
server. In these cases, storage backends can override the cross-storage
behavior by overriding the following methods:

* `copyFromStorage(\OCP\Files\Storage $sourceStorage, $sourceInternalPath, $targetInternalPath, $preserveMtime = false);`
* `moveFromStorage(\OCP\Files\Storage $sourceStorage, $sourceInternalPath ,$targetInternalPath);`

[[working-with-streams]]
Working With Streams
--------------------

Both `fopen()` and `opendir()` require storage backends to return native
PHP streams for maximum compatibility. ownCloud comes with several
classes which make it easier for storage backends to create native PHP
streams for backends not supported by PHP’s own
https://secure.php.net/manual/en/class.streamwrapper.php[streamWrapper].

[[iteratordirectory]]
IteratorDirectory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Icewind\Streams\IteratorDirectory` allows for creating a directory
handle from an array or iterator.

[source,php]
----
$fileNames = $this->getFolderContentsSomehow();
return IteratorDirectory::wrap($fileNames);
----

[[callbackwrapper]]
CallbackWrapper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Icewind\Streams\CallbackWrapper` wraps an existing file handle, and
allows for hooking into file reads and writes, and closing streams. The
most common use case for this class in storage backends is for
implementing `fopen()` with writable streams. This is because writing to
and closing streams happens outside the storage implementation. As a
result, the storage backend needs a way to upload the changed file back
to the backend. This can be done by attaching a close-callback to a
stream for a temporary file.

[source,php]
----
$tempFile = $this->downloadFile($path);
$handle = fopen($tempFile, $mode);
return CallBackWrapper::wrap($handle, null, null function() use ($path, $tempFile) {
    $this->uploadFile($tempFile, $path);
    unlink($tempFile);
}
----

[[storage-wrappers]]
Storage Wrappers
----------------

Besides implementing a complete custom storage backend, ownCloud allows
for modifying the behavior of an existing storage by applying a wrapper
to it. Storage wrappers need to implement the full storage API methods.
Examples of storage wrappers are

* *The Quota wrapper.* This changes the behavior of free_space by
limiting the free space returned by the wrapped storage to a configured
maximum
* *The Encryption wrapper*. This encrypts and decrypts the data on the
fly by overwriting `file_put_contents`, `file_get_contents`, and
`fopen`.

When implementing a storage wrapper, the wrapped storage is available as
`$this->storage`. Storage wrappers can either be applied globally to all
used storages using
`\OC\Files\Filesystem::addStorageWrapper($name, $wrapper)` or to a
specific storage, while mounting the storage from the app. Implementing
a storage wrapper is done by sub-classing
`\OC\Files\Storage\Wrapper\Wrapper` and overwriting any of its methods.

[[global-storage-wrappers]]
Global Storage Wrappers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For using a storage wrapper globally, you provide a callback which will
be called for each used storage. The callback can than determine if a
wrapper should be applied to the given storage, based on the storage or
mountpoint, or whether it needs to return the storage unwrapped.

[source,php]
----
Filesystem::addStorageWrapper('fooWrapper', function($mountPoint, $storage) {
    if ($storage->instanceOfStorage('FooStorage')) {
        return new FooWrapper(['storage' => $storage]);
    } else {
        return $storage;
    }
}
----

[[wrappers-for-a-single-storage]]
Wrappers for a Single Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes an app can avoid having to create a custom storage backend by
instead modifying the behavior of an existing one. ownCloud comes with a
few generic storage wrappers which might be useful when doing so, which
include `PermissionsMask` and `Jail`.

[[permissionsmask]]
PermissionsMask
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`\OC\Files\Storage\Wrapper\PermissionsMask` can be used to restrict the
permissions on an existing storage. A sample use case is to create a
read-only ftp backend.

[source,php]
----
$storage = $this->createStorageToWrapSomehow();
return new PermissionsMask([
   'storage' => $storage, 
   'mask' => \OCP\Constant::PERMISSION_READ | \OCP\Constant::PERMISSION_SHARE
]);
----

[[jail]]
Jail
^^^^

`\OC\Files\Storage\Wrapper\Jail` can be used to limit storage
interaction to a sub-folder of an existing storage.

[source,php]
----
$storage = $this->createStorageToWrapSomehow();
return new Jail([
   'storage' => $storage, 
   'root' => 'some/folder/in/the/storage'
]);
----

[[a-note-on-instanceof]]
A Note on instanceof()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since storage wrappers wrap an existing storage instead of sub-classing
it, it is not possible to determine if the storage is a specific class
using PHP’s `instanceof` operator. Instead, you need to call the
`instanceOfStorage()` method on the class with the fully-qualified class
name.

[source,php]
----
// Only works if no wrappers are applied
if ($storage instanceof \OC\Files\Storage\DAV) {
    // ...
}

// Works regardless of any wrapper
if ($storage->instanceOfStorage('\OC\Files\Storage\DAV')) {
    // ...
}
----

`instanceOfStorage()` can also be used to check if a certain wrapper is
applied to a storage.

[[mounting-storages]]
Mounting Storages
-----------------

For an app to add its storages to the filesystem it should implement a
mount provider and register it with the filesystem. Implementing mount
providers is done by implementing the `\OCP\Files\Config\IMountProvider`
interface, containing the
`getMountsForUser(IUser $user, IStorageFactory $storageFactory)` method,
which returns a list of mountpoints that should be created for a user.

[source,php]
----
class MyMountProvider implements IMountProvider {
    public function getMountsForUser(IUser $user, IStorageFactory $loader) {
        $config = magicallyGetMountConfigurations();
        return array_map(function($mountOptions) use ($loader) {
            return new Mount(
                $mountOptions['class'], 
                $mountOptions['mountPoint'], 
                $mountOptions['storageOptions'], 
                $loader
            );
        }, $config);
    }
}
----

Registering a mount provider should be done from an app’s
`appinfo/app.php`. Note that any mount provider registered after the
filesystem is setup for a user will not be called again for that user.

[source,php]
----
$provider = new MyMountProvider();
\OC::$server->getMountProviderCollection()
            ->registerProvider($provider);
----
