= The Classloader

The classloader is provided by ownCloud and loads all your classes
automatically. The only thing left to include by yourself are 3rd party
libraries. Those should be loaded in lib/AppInfo/Application.php.

PSR-4 Autoloading
-----------------

Since ownCloud 9.1 there is a PSR-4 autoloader in place. The namespace
`\\OCA\\MyApp` is mapped to /apps/myapp/lib/. Afterward, normal PSR-4
rules apply, so a folder is a namespace section in the same casing and
the class name matches the file name.

If your `appid` can not be turned into the namespace by upper-casing the
first character, you can specify it in your `appinfo/info.xml` by
providing a field called `namespace`. The required namespace is the one
which comes after the top level namespace `OCA\\`, e.g.: for
`OCA\\MyBeautifulApp\\Some\\OtherClass` the needed namespace would be
`MyBeautifulApp` and would be added to the `info.xml` in the following
way:

________________________________________
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<info>
   <namespace>MyBeautifulApp</namespace>
   <!-- other options here ... -->
</info>
----
________________________________________

A second PSR-4 root is available when running tests.
`\\OCA\\MyApp\\Tests` is thereby mapped to /apps/myapp/tests/.

[[legacy-autoloading]]
== Legacy Autoloading

The legacy classloader, deprecated since 9.1, is still in place and
works like this:

* Take the full qualifier of a class

[source,php]
----
\OCA\MyApp\Controller\PageController
----

* If it starts with `\\OCA`, then include the file from the apps
directory
* Cut off `\\OCA`

[source,php]
----
\MyApp\Controller\PageController
----

* Convert all characters to lowercase

[source,php]
----
\myapp\controller\pagecontroller
----

* Replace \ with /

[source,php]
----
/myapp/controller/pagecontroller
----

* Append .php

[source,php]
----
/myapp/controller/pagecontroller.php
----

* Prepend /apps because of the `OCA` namespace and include the file

[source,php]
----
require_once '/apps/myapp/controller/pagecontroller.php';
----

*In other words*: In order for the `PageController` class to be
autoloaded, the class `\\OCA\\MyApp\\Controller\\PageController` needs
to be stored in the /apps/myapp/controller/pagecontroller.php
