The Classloader
===============

The classloader is provided by ownCloud and loads all your classes
automatically. The only thing left to include by yourself are 3rd party
libraries. Those should be loaded in lib/AppInfo/Application.php.

PSR-4 Autoloading
-----------------

Since ownCloud 9.1 there is a PSR-4 autoloader in place. The namespace
`\\OCA\\MyApp` is mapped to /apps/myapp/lib/. Afterward, normal PSR-4
rules apply, so a folder is a namespace section in the same casing and
the class name matches the file name.

If your `appid` can not be turned into the namespace by upper-casing the
first character, you can specify it in your `appinfo/info.xml` by
providing a field called `namespace`. The required namespace is the one
which comes after the top level namespace `OCA\\`, e.g.: for
`OCA\\MyBeautifulApp\\Some\\OtherClass` the needed namespace would be
`MyBeautifulApp` and would be added to the `info.xml` in the following
way:

________________________________________
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<info>
   <namespace>MyBeautifulApp</namespace>
   <!-- other options here ... -->
</info>
----
________________________________________

A second PSR-4 root is available when running tests.
`\\OCA\\MyApp\\Tests` is thereby mapped to /apps/myapp/tests/.

Legacy Autoloading
------------------

The legacy classloader, deprecated since 9.1, is still in place and
works like this:

* Take the full qualifier of a class

[source,php]
----
\OCA\MyApp\Controller\PageController
----

* If it starts with `\\OCA`, then include the file from the apps
directory
* Cut off `\\OCA`

[source,php]
----
\MyApp\Controller\PageController
----

* Convert all characters to lowercase

[source,php]
----
\myapp\controller\pagecontroller
----

* Replace \ with /

[source,php]
----
/myapp/controller/pagecontroller
----

* Append .php

[source,php]
----
/myapp/controller/pagecontroller.php
----

* Prepend /apps because of the `OCA` namespace and include the file

[source,php]
----
require_once '/apps/myapp/controller/pagecontroller.php';
----

*In other words*: In order for the `PageController` class to be
autoloaded, the class `\\OCA\\MyApp\\Controller\\PageController` needs
to be stored in the /apps/myapp/controller/pagecontroller.php
