[[id]]
id
--

*Required*. This field contains the internal application name, and has
to be the same as the folder name of the application. This id needs to
be unique in ownCloud, meaning no other application should have this id.
This value also represents the URL your application is available on the
marketplace.

[[category]]
category
--------

The category you want to publish the application in. The following
categories are available for applications to be filed under.

[width="52%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|==================================
|Category Name |Value to Use
|Automation |automation
|Collaboration |collaboration
|Customization |customization
|External plugins |external-plugins
|Games |games
|Integration |integration
|Multimedia |multimedia
|Productivity |productivity
|Security |security
|Storage | storage
|Tools |tools
|==================================

For publishing themes this tag must be present — but empty.

[[description]]
description
-----------

max. 4000 characters; This provides all the necessary, detailed
information about the application. Don’t get lost in technical details,
focus on the benefits which the application offers. You can use
https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet[markdown]
to format the description.

[[name]]
name
----

*Required*. This is the human-readable name (or title) of the
application that will be displayed in the application overview page.

[[description-1]]
description
-----------

*Required*. This contains the description of the application which will
be shown in the application overview page.

[[version]]
version
-------

This sets the version of your application.

[[licence]]
licence
-------

*Required*. The sets the application’s license. This license must be
compatible with the AGPL and *must not be proprietary*.

Two good examples are:

* AGPL 3 (recommended)
* MIT

If a proprietary/non-AGPL compatible license must be used, then you have
to use the https://owncloud.com/overview/enterprise-edition[ownCloud
Enterprise Edition].

[[author]]
author
------

*Required*. The name of the application’s author or authors.

[[namespace]]
namespace
---------

Required if `routes.php` returns an array. For example, if your
application is namespaced, e.g.,
`\\OCA\\MyApp\\Controller\\PageController`, then the required namespace
value is `MyApp`. If a namespace is not provided, the application tries
to default to the first letter upper-cased application id, e.g., `myapp`
would be tried under `Myapp`.

[[summary]]
summary
-------

*Required*. Provide a short application description (max. 90 chars).
This gets displayed below the product title and on the product tiles. It
is mandatory since ownCloud 10.0.0.

[[types]]
types
-----

ownCloud supports five types. These are:

* `prelogin`: applications which need to load on the login page
* `filesystem`: applications which provide filesystem functionality
(e.g., file-sharing applications)
* `authentication`: applications which provide authentication backends
* `logging`: applications which implement a logging system
* `prevent_group_restriction`: applications which can not be enabled for
specific groups (e.g., notifications app).

`prevent_group_restriction` was introduced with ownCloud 9.0. It can be
used in earlier versions, but the functionality will be ignored.

Due to technical reasons applications of any type listed above can not
be enabled for specific groups only.

[[documentation]]
documentation
-------------

*Required*. Link to _admin_, _user_, and _developer_ documentation.
Common places are: (where `$name` is the name of your app, e.g.
`$name=theapp`)

[source,xml]
----
$DOCUMENTATION_BASE = 'https://doc.owncloud.org';
$DOCUMENTATION_DEVELOPER = $DOCUMENTATION_BASE.'/server/'.$VERSIONS_SERVER_MAJOR_DEV_DOCS.'/developer_manual/$name/';`
$DOCUMENTATION_ADMIN = $DOCUMENTATION_BASE.'/server/'.$VERSIONS_SERVER_MAJOR_STABLE.'/admin_manual/$name/';
$DOCUMENTATION_USER = $DOCUMENTATION_BASE.'/server/'.$VERSIONS_SERVER_MAJOR_STABLE.'/user_manual/$name/';
----

These places are maintained at
https://github.com/owncloud/documentation/. Another popular starting
point for developer documentation is the README.md in GitHub.

[[website]]
website
-------

*Required*. A link to the project’s web page.

[[repository]]
repository
----------

*Required*. A link to the version control repository.

[[dependencies]]
Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All tags within the dependencies tag define a set of requirements which
have to be fulfilled in order to operate properly. As soon as one of
these requirements is not met the application cannot be installed.

[[php]]
php
---

Defines the minimum and the maximum version of PHP required to run this
application.

[[database]]
database
--------

Each supported database has to be listed here. Valid values are
`sqlite`, `mysql`, `pgsql`, `oci` and `mssql`. In the future it will be
possible to specify versions here as well. In case no database is
specified it is assumed that all databases are supported.

[[command]]
command
-------

Defines a command line tool to be available. With the attribute `os` the
required operating system for this tool can be specified. Valid values
for the `os` attribute are as returned by the php function
http://php.net/manual/en/function.php-uname.php[php_uname].

[[lib]]
lib
---

Defines a required PHP extension with a required minimum and/or maximum
version. The names for the libraries have to match the result as
returned by the php function
http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-loaded-extensions.php[get_loaded_extensions].
The explicit version of an extension is read from
http://php.net/manual/de/function.phpversion.php[phpversion] - with some
exception as to be read up in the
https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/master/lib/private/app/platformrepository.php#L45[code
base]

[[os]]
os
--

Defines the required target operating system the application can run on.
Valid values are as returned by the php function
http://php.net/manual/en/function.php-uname.php[php_uname].

[[owncloud]]
owncloud
--------

Defines the minimum and maximum versions of ownCloud core.

This will be mandatory from version 11 onwards.

[[deprecated]]
Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections are listed just for reference and should not be
used because:

* *public/remote*: Use api instead because you’ll have to use
../../core/externalapi which is known to be buggy (works only properly
with GET/POST)
* *standalone/default_enable*: They tell core what do on setup, you will
not be able to even activate your application if it has those entries.
This should be replaced by a config file inside core.

[[public]]
public
------

Used to provide a public interface (requires no login) for the
application. The id is appended to the URL `/owncloud/index.php/public`.
Example with id set to `calendar':

....
/owncloud/index.php/public/calendar
....

Also take a look at ../../core/externalapi.

[[remote]]
remote
------

Same as public, but requires login. The id is appended to the URL
`/owncloud/index.php/remote`. Example with id set to `calendar':

....
/owncloud/index.php/remote/calendar
....

Also take a look at ../../core/externalapi.

[[standalone]]
standalone
----------

Can be set to `true` to indicate that this application is a web
application. This can be used to tell GNOME Web for instance to treat
this like a native application.

[[default_enable]]
default_enable
--------------

*Core applications only*: Used to tell ownCloud to enable them after the
installation.

[[shipped]]
shipped
-------

*Core applications only*: Used to tell ownCloud that the application is
in the standard release. Please note that if this attribute is set to
`FALSE` or not set at all, every time you disable the application, all
the files of the application itself will be _REMOVED_ from the server!
