Publishing in the ownCloud Marketplace
======================================

[[the-owncloud-marketplace]]
The ownCloud Marketplace
------------------------

With the ownCloud marketplace, introduced in 2017, we offer a flexible
and easy way to publish your apps and extend your ownCloud. In addition
every ownCloud gets shipped with the new market app which makes it
possible to manage apps directly out of your running ownCloud instance.
Connected with the ownCloud marketplace it mirrors your marketplace
account and provides an easy way to install and update apps.

The process of publishing apps aims to be:

* Secure
* Transparent
* Welcoming
* Fair
* Easy to maintain

Apps in the store are divided into three levels of trust:

* Official
* Approved
* Experimental

With each level come requirements and a position in the store.

[[official]]
Official
~~~~~~~~

Official apps are developed by and within the ownCloud community and its
https://github.com/owncloud[Github] repository and offer functionality
central to ownCloud. They are ready for serious use and can be
considered a part of ownCloud.

Requirements:

* Developed in the ownCloud GitHub repo.
* Minimum of 2 active maintainers and contributions from others.
* Security audited and design reviewed.
* App is at least six months old and has seen regular releases.
* Follows app guidelines.
* Supports the same platforms and technologies mentioned in the release
notes of the ownCloud version this app is made for.

ownCloud Marketplace:

* Available in Apps page in a separate category.
* Sorted first in all overviews, `Official` tag.
* Shown as featured on https://owncloud.org, etc.
* Major releases optionally featured on https://owncloud.org and sent to
owncloud-announce list.
* New versions/updates approved by at least one other person.

Official apps include those that are part of the release tarball. We’d
like to keep the tarball minimal, so most official apps are not part of
the standard installation.

[[approved]]
Approved
~~~~~~~~

Approved apps are developed by trusted developers and have passed a
cursory security check. They are actively maintained in an open code
repository, and their maintainers deem them to be stable for casual to
normal use.

Requirements:

* Code is developed in an open and version-managed code repository,
ideally GitHub, with git. But other VCS’ and hosting options are also
OK.
* Minimum of one active developer/maintainer.
* Minimum 5 ratings, average score 60/100 or better.
* App is at least three months old.
* Follows app guidelines.
* The developer is trusted.
* App is subject to unannounced security audits.
* Has defined requirements and dependencies (like what browsers,
databases, PHP versions and so on are supported).

*Developer trust*: The developer(s) is/are known in the community;
he/she has/have been active for a while, have met others at events
and/or worked with others in various areas.

*Security audits*: in practice, this means that at least some of the
code of this developer has been audited; either through another app by
the same developer or with an earlier version of the app. And that the
attitude of the developer towards these audits has been positive.

ownCloud Marketplace:

* Visible in ownCloud Marketplace by default
* Sorted above experimental apps
* Search results sorted by ratings
* Developer can directly push new versions to the store
* Warning shows for security/stability risks

[[experimental]]
Experimental
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apps which have not been checked at all for security and/or are new,
known to be unstable or under heavy development.

Requirements:

* No malicious intent found from this developer at any time
* 0 confirmed security problems
* Less than three unconfirmed `security flags'
* Rating over 20/100

ownCloud Marketplace:

* Show up in Apps page provided user has enabled ``allow installation of
experimental apps` in the settings.
* Warning about security and stability risks is shown for app
* Sorted below all others.

[[app-categories]]
App Categories
--------------

The following categories are available for apps to be filed under:

* Automation
* Collaboration
* Customization
* External plugins
* Games
* Integration
* Multimedia
* Productivity
* Security
* Storage
* Tools

To make your app available under one of these categories, please make
sure to user the proper tag in your `info.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<category>security</category>
----

Note: For publishing themes, this tag must be present but empty.

[source,xml]
----
<category></category>
----

[[app-tags]]
App Tags
--------

Besides these categories apps can have different tags:

* Enterprise
* Verified
* Trusted

[[enterprise]]
Enterprise
~~~~~~~~~~

Apps with the `Enterprise` tag are official ownCloud enterprise apps.
These can only be uploaded by ownCloud itself and represent ownCloud
Enterprise Edition features.

[[verified]]
Verified
~~~~~~~~

To get the `verified` label on your app, you must request a review. We
then will look into your app and check if it meets the ownCloud app
development guidelines (see below). The advantages of verified apps are
that:

* they are labeled with `verified` badge.
* they are available in apps page in separate category.
* only verified apps can be displayed in the `featured` area.
* major releases optionally featured on https://owncloud.org and sent to
the owncloud-announce list.

[[trusted]]
Trusted
~~~~~~~

If your app reaches a rating level of 4 or higher based on 40 ratings or
more it automatically gets the badge `trusted`. It represents a
community oriented level of quality which makes it more attractive to
other users. The advantages of trusted apps are that:

* they are labeled with `trusted` badge.
* the user can filter by trusted apps.

[[app-review-process]]
App Review Process
------------------

To request an app review go to `Account` > ``My Products` > ``Edit
app` and click on the button ``Request review`. Usually, it takes 3-5
work days to review your app. You will be notified about the result.

If it is successful, your app will get the `verified` badge. Please be
aware of when uploading a new release to a verified app, you need to
request a new review for the new release. To keep your verified badge,
request the review before setting your new release to `published`.

[[app-guidelines]]
App Guidelines
--------------

The following are the guidelines your app should follow to provide a
high quality.

[[legal-and-security]]
Legal and Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Apps can not use `ownCloud` in their name
* Irregular and unannounced security audits of all apps can and will
take place.
* If any indication of malicious intent or bad faith is found the
developer(s) in question can count on a minimum two-year ban from any
ownCloud infrastructure.
* Malicious intent includes deliberate spying on users by leaking user
data to a third party system or adding a back door (like a hard coded
user account) to ownCloud. An unintentional security bug that gets fixed
in time won’t be considered bad faith.
* Apps do not violate any laws; it has to comply with copyright- and
trademark law.
* App authors have to respond timely to security concerns and not make
ownCloud more vulnerable to attack.

Distributing malicious or illegal applications can have legal
consequences including, but not limited to ownCloud or affected users
taking legal action.

[[technical]]
Technical
~~~~~~~~~

* Apps can only use the public ownCloud API
* At time of the release of an app, it can only be configured to be
compatible with the latest ownCloud release +1
* Apps should not cause ownCloud to break, consume excessive memory or
slow ownCloud down
* Apps should not hamper functionality of ownCloud unless that is
explicitly the goal of the app

[[providing-information]]
Providing Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When uploading an app, it should provide a professional and informative
look and feel. To do so, please consider the following three points:

* The title of your app can be up to 50 characters. Provide a unique
name, which makes it easy for users to identify the product. Do not
include your developer and/or company name in the title.
* The summary of your app can be up to 90 characters. Provide a short
description. This will be displayed below the product titles.
* The description of your app can be up to 4000 characters and supports
Markdown formatting. It should, ideally, provide all the necessary
information about your app — especially information necessary to
convince the user to download, use, and buy your app. So, don’t get lost
in technical details. Explain in simple, yet precise, steps what the
user will get. When writing, focus on the benefits your app offers.

[[images]]
Images
~~~~~~

* Provide meaningful images to your users.
* For best results, images should be 1400px wide and should go with a
rough aspect ratio of 2:1
* The first image provided in your apps info.xml will be used as the
preview image and is displayed in the top area of your marketplace app
page.

[[respect-the-users]]
Respect the Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Apps have to follow design and HTML/CSS layout guidelines
* Apps correctly clean up after themselves on uninstall and correctly
handle up- and downgrades
* Apps communicate their intended purpose and active features, including
features introduced through updates.
* Apps respect the users’ choices and do not make unexpected changes, or
limit users’ ability to revert them. For example, they do not remove
other apps or disable settings.
* Apps must respect user privacy. If user data is sent anywhere, this
must be explained and be kept to a minimum for the functioning of an
app. Use proper security measures when needed.

[[disclaimer]]
