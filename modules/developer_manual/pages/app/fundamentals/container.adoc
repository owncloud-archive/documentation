The DI Container
================

The App Framework assembles the application by using a container based
on the software pattern
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection[Dependency
Injection]. This makes the code easier to test and thus easier to
maintain.

If you are unfamiliar with this pattern, watch the following videos:

* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNtg4_i-2w[Dependency Injection and
the art of Services and Containers Tutorial]

Dependency Injection
--------------------

Dependency Injection sounds pretty complicated but it just means: Don’t
put new dependencies in your constructor or methods but pass them in. So
this:

[source,php]
----
<?php

// without dependency injection
class AuthorMapper {

  private $db;

  public function __construct() {
    $this->db = new Db();
  }

}
----

would turn into this by using Dependency Injection:

[source,php]
----
<?php

// with dependency injection
class AuthorMapper {

  private $db;

  public function __construct($db) {
    $this->db = $db;
  }

}
----

[[using-a-container]]
Using a Container
-----------------

Passing dependencies into the constructor rather than instantiating them
in the constructor has the following drawback: Every line in the source
code where `new AuthorMapper` is being used has to be changed, once a
new constructor argument is being added to it.

The solution for this particular problem is to limit the
`new AuthorMapper` to one file, the container. The container contains
all the factories for creating these objects and is configured in
lib/AppInfo/Application.php.

To add the app’s classes simply open the lib/AppInfo/Application.php and
use the `registerService` method on the container object:

[source,php]
----
<?php

namespace OCA\MyApp\AppInfo;

use \OCP\AppFramework\App;

use \OCA\MyApp\Controller\AuthorController;
use \OCA\MyApp\Service\AuthorService;
use \OCA\MyApp\Db\AuthorMapper;

class Application extends App {


  /**
   * Define your dependencies in here
   */
  public function __construct(array $urlParams=[]){
    parent::__construct('myapp', $urlParams);

    $container = $this->getContainer();

    /**
     * Controllers
     */
    $container->registerService('AuthorController', function($c){
      return new AuthorController(
        $c->query('AppName'),
        $c->query('Request'),
        $c->query('AuthorService')
      );
    });

    /**
     * Services
     */
    $container->registerService('AuthorService', function($c){
      return new AuthorService(
        $c->query('AuthorMapper')
      );
    });

    /**
     * Mappers
     */
    $container->registerService('AuthorMapper', function($c){
      return new AuthorMapper(
        $c->query('ServerContainer')->getDb()
      );
    });
  }
}
----

[[how-the-container-works]]
How the Container Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The container works in the following way:

* A request comes in and is matched against a route <../tutorial/request>
(for the `AuthorController` in this case)
* The matched route queries `AuthorController` service from the
container:
+
....
return new AuthorController(
  $c->query('AppName'),
  $c->query('Request'),
  $c->query('AuthorService')
);
....
* The `AppName` is queried and returned from the baseclass
* The `Request` is queried and returned from the server container
* `AuthorService` is queried:
+
....
$container->registerService('AuthorService', function($c){
  return new AuthorService(
    $c->query('AuthorMapper')
  );
});
....
* `AuthorMapper` is queried:
+
....
$container->registerService('AuthorMappers', function($c){
  return new AuthorService(
    $c->query('ServerContainer')->getDb()
  );
});
....
* The `database connection` is returned from the server container
* Now `AuthorMapper` has all of its dependencies and the object is
returned
* `AuthorService` gets the `AuthorMapper` and returns the object
* `AuthorController` gets the `AuthorService` and finally the controller
can be instantiated and the object is returned

So basically the container is used as a giant factory to build all the
classes that are needed for the application. Because it centralizes all
the creation of objects (the `new Class()` lines), it is very easy to
add new constructor parameters without breaking existing code: only the
`__construct` method and the container line where the `new` is being
called need to be changed.

[[use-automatic-dependency-assembly-recommended]]
Use Automatic Dependency Assembly (Recommended)
-----------------------------------------------

Since ownCloud 8 it is possible to omit the
`lib/AppInfo/Application.php` and use automatic dependency assembly
instead.

[[how-does-automatic-assembly-work]]
How Does Automatic Assembly Work
--------------------------------

Automatic assembly creates new instances of classes just by looking at
the class name and its constructor parameters. For each constructor
parameter the type or the variable name is used to query the container,
e.g.:

* `SomeType $type` will use `$container->query('SomeType')`
* `$variable` will use `$container->query('variable')`

If all constructor parameters are resolved, the class will be created,
saved as a service and returned. So basically the following is now
possible:

[source,php]
----
<?php
namespace OCA\MyApp;

class MyTestClass {}

class MyTestClass2 {
    public $class;
    public $appName;

    public function __construct(MyTestClass $class, $AppName) {
        $this->class = $class;
        $this->appName = $AppName;
    }
}

$app = new \OCP\AppFramework\App('myapp');

$class2 = $app->getContainer()->query('OCA\MyApp\MyTestClass2');

$class2 instanceof MyTestClass2;  // true
$class2->class instanceof MyTestClass;  // true
$class2->appName === 'myapp';  // true
$class2 === $app->getContainer()->query('OCA\MyApp\MyTestClass2');  // true
----

$AppName is resolved because the container registered a parameter under
the key `AppName' which will return the app id. The lookup is case
sensitive so while `$AppName` will work correctly, using `$appName` as a
constructor parameter will fail.

[[how-does-it-affect-the-request-lifecycle]]
How Does it Affect the Request Lifecycle
----------------------------------------

* A request comes in
* All apps’ `routes.php` files are loaded
** If a `routes.php` file returns an array, and an
`appname/lib/AppInfo/Application.php` exists, include it, create a new
instance of `\\OCA\\AppName\\AppInfo\\Application.php` and register the
routes on it. That way a container can be used while still benefitting
from the new routes behavior
** If a `routes.php` file returns an array, but there is no
`appname/lib/AppInfo/Application.php`, create a new
\OCP\AppFramework\App instance with the app id and register the routes
on it
* A request is matched for the route, e.g. with the name `page#index`
* The appropriate container is being queried for the entry
PageController (to keep backwards compability)
* If the entry does not exist, the container is queried for
OCA\AppName\Controller\PageController and if no entry exists, the
container tries to create the class by using reflection on its
constructor parameters

[[how-does-this-affect-controllers]]
How Does This Affect Controllers
--------------------------------

The only thing that needs to be done to add a route and a controller
method is now:

`myapp/appinfo/routes.php`

[source,php]
----
<?php
return ['routes' => [
    ['name' => 'page#index', 'url' => '/', 'verb' => 'GET'],
]];
----

`myapp/appinfo/lib/Controller/PageController.php`

[source,php]
----
<?php
namespace OCA\MyApp\Controller;

class PageController {
    public function __construct($AppName, \OCP\IRequest $request) {
        parent::__construct($AppName, $request);
    }

    public function index() {
        // your code here
    }
}
----

There is no need to wire up anything in `lib/AppInfo/Application.php`.
Everything will be done automatically.

[[how-to-deal-with-interface-and-primitive-type-parameters]]
How to Deal with Interface and Primitive Type Parameters
--------------------------------------------------------

Interfaces and primitive types can not be instantiated, so the container
can not automatically assemble them. The actual implementation needs to
be wired up in the container:

[source,php]
----
<?php

namespace OCA\MyApp\AppInfo;

class Application extends \OCP\AppFramework\App {

    /**
     * Define your dependencies in here
     */
    public function __construct(array $urlParams=[]){
        parent::__construct('myapp', $urlParams);

        $container = $this->getContainer();

        // AuthorMapper requires a location as string called $TableName
        $container->registerParameter('TableName', 'my_app_table');

        // the interface is called IAuthorMapper and AuthorMapper implements it
        $container->registerService('OCA\MyApp\Db\IAuthorMapper', function ($c) {
            return $c->query('OCA\MyApp\Db\AuthorMapper');
        });
    }

}

[[predefined-core-services]]
Predefined Core Services
------------------------

The following parameter names and type hints can be used to inject core
services instead of using `$container->getServer()->getServiceX()`

Parameters:

* `AppName`: The app id
* `WebRoot`: The path to the ownCloud installation
* `UserId`: The id of the current user

Types:

* `OCP\\IAppConfig`
* `OCP\\IAppManager`
* `OCP\\IAvatarManager`
* `OCP\\Activity\\IManager`
* `OCP\\ICache`
* `OCP\\ICacheFactory`
* `OCP\\IConfig`
* `OCP\\AppFramework\\Utility\\IControllerMethodReflector`
* `OCP\\Contacts\\IManager`
* `OCP\\IDateTimeZone`
* `OCP\\IDb`
* `OCP\\IDBConnection`
* `OCP\\Diagnostics\\IEventLogger`
* `OCP\\Diagnostics\\IQueryLogger`
* `OCP\\Files\\Config\\IMountProviderCollection`

* `OCP\\Security\\ICrypto`
* `OCP\\Security\\IHasher`
* `OCP\\Security\\ISecureRandom`
* `OCP\\IURLGenerator`
* `OCP\\IUserManager`
* `OCP\\IUserSession`

[[how-to-enable-it]]
How to Enable It
----------------

To make use of this new feature, the following things have to be done:

* `appinfo/info.xml` requires to provide another field called
`namespace` where the namespace of the app is defined. The required
namespace is the one which comes after the top level namespace `OCA\\`,
e.g.: for `OCA\\MyBeautifulApp\\Some\\OtherClass` the needed namespace
would be `MyBeautifulApp` and would be added to the info.xml in the
following way:
+
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<info>
   <namespace>MyBeautifulApp</namespace>
   <!-- other options here ... -->
</info>
----
* `appinfo/routes.php`: Instead of creating a new Application class
instance, simply return the routes array like:
+
[source,php]
----
<?php
return ['routes' => [
    ['name' => 'page#index', 'url' => '/', 'verb' => 'GET'],
]];
----

A namespace tag is required because you can not deduce the namespace
from the app id

[[which-classes-should-be-added]]
Which Classes Should Be Added
-----------------------------

In general all of the app’s controllers need to be registered inside the
container. Then the following question is: What goes into the
constructor of the controller? Pass everything into the controller
constructor that matches one of the following criteria:

* It does I/O (database, write/read to files)
* It is a global (e.g. $_POST, etc. This is in the request class by the
way)
* The output does not depend on the input variables (also called
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function[impure function]), e.g. time,
random number generator
* It is a service, basically it would make sense to swap it out for a
different object

What not to inject:

* It is pure data and has methods that only act upon it (arrays, data
objects)
* It is a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function[pure function]
