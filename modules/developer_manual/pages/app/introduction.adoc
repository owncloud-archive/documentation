Introduction
============

ownCloud applications let you extend and build on the power of ownCloud,
taking it in ways that work just for your specific use-case(s).

While not overly complex in nature, like any form of software
development, it will take some time to become fully knowledgeable on the
parts that make up and application, how they fit together, and how to
make best use of them.

This section of the documentation’s been designed to make that process
as simple and as effective as possible, by both stepping you through the
information in a tutorial-fashion, as well as providing you a
significant amount of background technical knowledge.

You’ll learn how an application works by building one. It won’t do
absolutely everything that you could possibly hope to cover. But it will
teach you the ins and outs of building one, providing links to further
information, which you can work through later.

Before you start developing an ownCloud application, please check that
there isn’t an application in the
https://marketplace.owncloud.com/[ownCloud Marketplace], or an official
https://marketplace.owncloud.com/publishers/owncloud[ownCloud app] that
already does what you need. If there is, we strongly encourage you to
contribute to existing applications before investing the time to develop
your own. Also, feel free to communicate your idea and plans to the
https://mailman.owncloud.org/mailman/listinfo/user[user mailing list] or
https://mailman.owncloud.org/mailman/listinfo/devel[developer mailing
list] so other contributors might join in.
