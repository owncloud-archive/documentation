Add JavaScript and CSS
======================

To create a modern web application you need to write
JavaScript <../fundamentals/js> and CSS <../fundamentals/css>.

[[javascript]]
JavaScript
----------

You can use any JavaScript framework but for this tutorial we want to
keep it as simple as possible and therefore only include the templating
library http://handlebarsjs.com/[handlebarsjs].
http://builds.handlebarsjs.com.s3.amazonaws.com/handlebars-v2.0.0.js[Download
the file] into `ownnotes/js/handlebars.js` and include it at the very
top of `ownnotes/templates/main.php` before the other scripts and
styles:

[source,php]
----
<?php
script('ownnotes', 'handlebars');
----

The `script` method’s first parameter specifies the application which
the JavaScript should be included for. This helps increase performance
by not including the JavaScript unnecessarily. The script’s second
parameter is the name of the JavaScript file, located in the
application’s `js` directory, minus the `.js` extension. In the case
above, `ownnotes/js/handlebars.js` would be loaded.

jQuery is included by default on every page.

[[css]]
CSS
---

To include CSS, use the template’s `style` method, as in the example
below. As with `script`, the first parameter is the application to find
the CSS file in and the second parameter is the name of the CSS file,
minus the `.css` file extension.

[source,php]
----
style('ownnotes, 'style');  // adds ownnotes/css/style.css
----

ownCloud doesn’t provide automatic JavaScript or CSS minification
