Tutorial
========

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to create an ownCloud application, by
stepping through the process of creating one to manage a set of notes.
The application will support _listing_, _viewing_, _creating_,
_updating_, and _deleting_ notes. It will step through as many concepts
and techniques as possible, while not using concepts, just to do so.
