Minimum Requirements
====================

Before you can develop ownCloud applications, as with developing other
software applications, you have to ensure that you have a working
development environment.

To do that:

* First, ensure that your development environment meets the minimum
requirements
* Then, create the core files that any ownCloud application needs

There aren’t many; all that you’ll need is:

* PHP, with a minimum version of 5.6, though ideally 7.1
* A copy of ownCloud core
* A working installation of ownCloud server

To find out more, read through
the Development Environment section <../../general/devenv>. When you’ve
done everything that it suggests, you’re ready to begin developing an
ownCloud application.
