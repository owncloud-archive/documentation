ownCloud Test Pilots
====================

The ownCloud Test Pilots help to test and improve different server and
client setups with ownCloud.

[[what-do-you-do]]
What do you do
--------------

You will receive emails from the mailing list and also from the bug
tracker if developers need your help. Also, there will be announcements
of new releases and preview releases on the mailing list, which give you
the possibility to test releases early and to help the developers fix
them.

We are looking forward to working with you :)

[[why-do-you-want-to-join]]
Why do you want to join
-----------------------

There are many different setups, and people have different interests. If
we want ownCloud to run well on NGINX, for instance, someone has to test
this configuration. Furthermore, during bug fixing the ownCloud
developers often do not have the possibility to reproduce the bug in a
given environment, nor are they able confirm if it was fixed.

As a member of the Test Pilot Team you could act as a contact person for
a particular area to help developers *fix the bugs you care about*.
Testing ownCloud before it is released is the best way of making sure it
does what you need.

Another benefit is a closer relationship with the developers, because
you will know which people are responsible for which parts, and it will
be easier to get help.

If you want, you can also be listed as an active contributor on the
https://owncloud.org[owncloud.org] page.

How do you test
---------------

Testing follows these steps:

1.  Setup your testing environment
2.  Pick something to test
3.  Test it
4.  Go Back to step 2 until something unexpected/bad happens
5.  Check if what you found is a genuine bug
6.  File the bug

Installing ownCloud
-------------------

Testing starts with setting up a testing environment. We urge you not to
put your production data on testing releases unless you have a backup
somewhere!

Start by installing ownCloud, either on real hardware or in a VM. You
can find instructions for installation in the
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/[documentation].

Please note that we are still working on the documentation and if you
bump into a problem, you can
https://github.com/owncloud/documentation[help us fix it]. Small things
can be edited straight on GitHub.

The Real Testing
----------------

Testing is a matter of trying out some scenarios you decide on or were
asked to test, for example, sharing a folder and mounting it on another
ownCloud instance. If it works – awesome, move on. If it doesn’t, find
out as much as you can about why it doesn’t and use that for a bug
report.

This is the stage where you should see if your issue is already reported
by checking the relevant bug tracker <../bugtracker/index>. It might
even be fixed, sometimes! Alternatively, just ask on the test-pilots
mailing list.

Finally, if the issue you bump into is a definite bug and the developers
are not aware of it, file it as a new issue in
the relevant bug tracker <../bugtracker/index>.
