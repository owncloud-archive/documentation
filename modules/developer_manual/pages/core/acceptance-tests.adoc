The Test Directory Structure
----------------------------

This is the structure of acceptance directory inside
https://github.com/owncloud/core[the core repository’s] `tests`
directory:

[source,bash]
----
tests
├── acceptance
│   ├── composer.json
│   ├── composer.lock
│   ├── config
│   │   └── behat.yml
│   ├── data
│   │   └── textfile.txt
│   ├── features
│   │   ├── feature files (behat gherkin files)
│   │   └── bootstrap
│   │       └── Contexts and traits (php files)
│   ├── federation_features
│   │   └── federated.feature (feature on a separated context)
│   ├── run.sh
│   ├── skeleton
│   ├── vendor
----

Here’s a short description of each component of the directory.

[[composer.json-and-composer.lock]]
`composer.json` and `composer.lock`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These files store the required dependencies for the acceptance tests.
This can include libraries such as sabredav, guzzle, or behat.

[[config]]
`config/`
~~~~~~~~~

This directory contains `behat.yml` which sets up the acceptance tests.
In this file we can add new contexts and new features. Here’s an example
configuration:

....
default:
  autoload:
    `: %paths.base%/../features/bootstrap
  suites:
    default:
      paths:
        + %paths.base%/../features
      contexts:
        + FeatureContext:
            baseUrl:  http://localhost:8080/ocs/
            admin:
              + admin
              + admin
            regular_user_password: 123456
        + CommentsContext:
            baseUrl: http://localhost:8080
....

[[data]]
`data/`
~~~~~~~

This folder can be used in tests to store temporary data.

[[features]]
`features/`
~~~~~~~~~~~

This directory stores
http://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/guides/1.gherkin.html[Behat’s feature
files]. These contain Behat’s test cases, called scenarios, which use
the Gherkin language.

[[featurebootstrap]]
`feature/bootstrap`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This folder contains all the Behat contexts. Contexts contain the PHP
code required to run Behat’s scenarios. Every feature file has to have
at least one context associated with it.

[[run.sh]]
`run.sh`
~~~~~~~~

This script runs the tests suites. To use it we need to use the web
server user, which is normally `www-data` or `apache`.

[[skeleton]]
`skeleton/`
~~~~~~~~~~~

This folder stores the initial files loaded for a new user.

[[how-to-add-a-new-feature]]
How to Add a New Feature
------------------------

Creation of a new feature file is recommended when the task being tested
is independent enough from the existing features. In this section, we’ll
step through the creation of a hypothetical feature.

The first thing we need to do is create a new file for the context;
we’ll name it TaskToTestContext.php. In the file, we’ll add the code
snippet below:

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Behat\Behat\Context\Context;
use Behat\Behat\Context\SnippetAcceptingContext;

require __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/autoload.php';

/**
 * Example Context.
 */
class ExampleContext implements Context, SnippetAcceptingContext {
  use Webdav;
}
----

Each scenario relating to the new feature being tested should be added
here. To add a function to run as a scenario step, do the following:

* Use a `@When`, `@Given`, or `@Then` statement at the beginning.
* For parameters you could use either regular expressions or use a
`:variable`. But, using colons is preferred.
* Document all the parameters of the function and their expected type.
* Be careful to write the exact sentence that you will write in the
gherkin code. Behat won’t parse it properly otherwise.

Here’s example code for a scenario:

[source,php]
----
/**
 * @When Sending a :method to :url with requesttoken
 *
 * @param string $method
 * @param string $url
 */
public function exampleFunction($method, $url) {
----

Following this, add a new feature file to `features/` folder. The name
should be in the format: `<task-to-test>.feature`. The content of this
file should be Gherkin code. You can use all the sentences available in
the rest of core contexts, just use the appropriate trait in your
context.

For example ``use Webdav;` for using WebDAV related functions. Lets
show an example of a feature file with scenarios:

[source,yaml]
----
Feature: provisioning
  Background:
    Given using api version "1"

  Scenario: Getting an not existing user
    When user "admin" sends HTTP method "GET" to API endpoint "/cloud/users/test"
    Then the OCS status code should be "998"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
----

* `Feature`: gives the feature its name, in this case: `provisioning`.
* `Background`: gives contextual information on assumptions which the
feature makes, what it relates to, and other aspects so that the
scenario can be properly understood.
* `Scenario`: contains the core information about a test scenario in
human-readable language, so that you can understand what the code will
have to do for the scenario to have been successfully implemented.

A scenario requires three parts, `"Given"`, `"When"`, and `"Then"`
sections. `"Given"` and `"Then"` can have several sentences joined
together by `"And"`, but `"When"` statements should just have one. And
this should be the function to test. The other parts are preconditions
and post-conditions of the test.

To be able to run your new feature tests you’ll have to add a new
context to `config/behat.yml` file. To do so, in the `contexts` section
add your new context:

....
contexts:
      * TaskToTestContext:
          baseUrl:  http://localhost:8080/ocs/
....

After the name, add all the variables required for your context. In this
example we add just the required `baseUrl` variable. With that done,
we’re now ready to run the tests.

Running Acceptance Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a concise guide to running acceptance tests on ownCloud 10.0.
Before you can do so, you need to meet a few prerequisites available;
these are

* ownCloud
* Composer
* MySQL

After cloning core, run `make` as your webserver’s user in the root
directory of the project.

Now that the prerequisites are satisfied, and assuming that
`$installation_path` is the location where you cloned the
`ownCloud/core` repository, the following commands will prepare the
installation for running the acceptance tests.

[source,bash]
----
# Remove current configuration (if existing)
sudo rm -rf $installation_path/data/*
sudo rm -rf $installation_path/config/*

# Remove existing 'owncloud' database 
mysql -u root -h localhost -e "drop database owncloud"
mysql -u root -h localhost -e "drop user oc_admin"
mysql -u root -h localhost -e "drop user oc_admin@localhost"

# Install owncloud server with the cli
sudo -u www-data $installation_path/occ maintenance:install \

  --database='mysql' --database-name='owncloud' --database-user='root' \
  --database-pass=` --admin-user='admin' --admin-pass='admin'
----

With the installation prepared, you should now be able to run the tests.
Go to the `tests/acceptance` folder and, assuming that your web user is
`www-data`, run the following command:

....
sudo -u www-data ./run.sh features/task-to-test.feature
....

If you want to use an alternative home name using the `env` variable add
to the execution `OC_TEST_ALT_HOME=1`, as in the following example:

__________________________________________________________________________
sudo -u www-data OC_TEST_ALT_HOME=1 ./run.sh
features/task-to-test.feature
__________________________________________________________________________

If you want to have encryption enabled add
`OC_TEST_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=1`, as in the following example:

____________________________________________________________________________________
sudo -u www-data OC_TEST_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=1 ./run.sh
features/task-to-test.feature
____________________________________________________________________________________
