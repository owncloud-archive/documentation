Theming ownCloud
================

Themes can be used to customize the look and feel of any aspect of an
ownCloud installation. They can override the default _JavaScript_,
_CSS_, _image_, and _template_ files, as well as the _user interface
translations_ with custom versions. They can also affect both the web
front-end and the ownCloud Desktop client. However, this documentation
only covers customizing the web front-end, _so far_.

Throughout this section of the documentation, for sakes of simplicity,
it will be assumed that your owncloud installation directory is
`/owncloud`. If you’re following this guide to create or customise a
theme, please make sure you change any references to match the location
of your owncloud installation.

To save you time and effort, you can use the shell script below, to
create the basis of a new theme from ownCloud’s example theme.

Using this script, you will have a new theme, ready to go, in less than
five seconds. You can execute this script with two variables; the first
one is the *theme name* and the second one is your *ownCloud directory*.

For example:

_______________________________________________
theme-bootstrap.sh mynewtheme /var/www/owncloud
_______________________________________________

[[how-to-create-a-new-theme]]
How to Create a New Theme
-------------------------

At its most basic, to create a theme requires two steps:

1.  Copy and extend https://github.com/owncloud/theme-example[an
existing theme] or create one from scratch.
2.  Enable the theme in the ownCloud Admin dashboard.

All themes, whether copied or new, must meet two key criteria, these
are:

1.  They must be store in an app directory of your ownCloud
installation, whether that’s the core app directory (`apps`) or
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/apps_management_installation.html#using-custom-app-directories[a
custom app directory].
2.  They require a configuration file called `appinfo/info.xml` to be
present.

To ensure that custom themes aren’t lost during upgrades, we strongly
encourage you to store them in
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/apps_management_installation.html#using-custom-app-directories[a
custom app directory].

[[appinfoinfo.xml]]
appinfo/info.xml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here’s an example of the bare minimum which the file needs to contain:

....
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<info>
    <id>theme-example</id>
    <name>Example Theme</name>
    <types>
        <theme/>
    </types>
    <dependencies>
      <owncloud min-version="10" max-version="10" />
    </dependencies>
</info>
....

And here’s a longer, more complete example:

....
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<info>
    <id>theme-example</id>
    <name>Example Theme</name>
    <description>This App provides the ownCloud theme.</description>
    <licence>AGPL</licence>
    <author>John Doe</author>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
    <types>
        <theme/>
    </types>
    <dependencies>
        <owncloud min-version="10" max-version="10" />
    </dependencies>
</info>
....

The value of the `id` element needs to be the name of your theme’s
folder. We recommend that it always be prefixed with `theme-`. The main
reason for doing so, is that it is alphabetically sorted in a terminal
when handling app folders.

The `type` element needs to be the same as is listed above, so that
ownCloud knows to handle the app as a theme. The dependencies element
needs to be present to set the minimum and maximum versions of ownCloud
which are supported. If it’s not present, a warning will be displayed in
ownCloud 10 and an error will be thrown in the upcoming ownCloud 11.

While the remaining elements are optional, they help when working with
the theme in the ownCloud Admin dashboard. Please consider filling out
as many as possible, as completely as possible.

[[theme-signing]]
Theme Signing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are going to publish the theme as an app in
https://marketplace.owncloud.com[the marketplace], you need to sign it.
However, if you are only creating a private theme for your own ownCloud
installation, then you do not need to.

That said, to avoid a signature warning in the ownCloud UI, you need to
add it to the `integrity.ignore.missing.app.signature` list in
`config/config.php`. The following example allows the app whose
application id is `app-id` to have no signature.

....
'integrity.ignore.missing.app.signature' => [
      'app-id',
 ],
....

[[how-to-override-images]]
How to Override Images
----------------------

Any image, such as the default logo, can be overridden by including one
with the same path structure in your theme. For example, let’s say that
you want to replace the logo on the login-page above the credentials-box
which, by default has the path: `owncloud/core/img/logo-icon.svg`. To
override it, assuming that your custom theme was called `theme-example`
(_which will be assumed for the remainder of the theming
documentation_), add a new file with the following path:
`owncloud/apps/theme-example/core/img/logo-icon.svg`. After the theme is
activated, this image will override the default one.

[[default-image-paths]]
Default Image Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make building a new theme that much easier, below is a list of a
range of the image paths used in the default theme.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Description |Section |Location
|The logo at the login-page above the credentials-box |General
|`owncloud/core/img/logo-icon.svg`

|The logo in the left upper corner after login |
|`owncloud/core/img/logo-icon.svg`

|All files folder image | |`owncloud/core/img/folder.svg`

|Favorites star image | |`owncloud/core/img/star.svg`

|Shared with you/others image | |`owncloud/core/img/share.svg`

|Shared by link image | |`owncloud/core/img/public.svg`

|Tags image | |`owncloud/core/img/tag.svg`

|Deleted files image | |`owncloud/core/img/delete.svg`

|Settings image | |`owncloud/core/img/actions/settings.svg`

|Search image | |`owncloud/core/img/actions/search-white.svg`

|Breadcrumbs home image | |`owncloud/core/img/places/home.svg`

|Breadcrumbs separator | |`owncloud/core/img/breadcrumb.svg`

|Dropdown arrow |Admin Menu |`owncloud/core/img/actions/caret.svg`

|Personal image | |`owncloud/settings/img/personal.svg`

|Users image | |`owncloud/settings/img/users.svg`

|Help image | |`owncloud/settings/img/help.svg`

|Admin image | |`owncloud/settings/img/admin.svg`

|Logout image | |`owncloud/core/img/actions/logout.svg`

|Apps menu - Files image | |`owncloud/apps/files/img/app.svg`

|Apps menu - Plus image | |`owncloud/settings/img/apps.svg`

|Upload image |Personal |`owncloud/core/img/actions/upload.svg`

|Folder image | |`owncloud/core/img/filetypes/folder.svg`

|Trash can image | |`owncloud/core/img/actions/delete.svg`
|=======================================================================

When overriding the favicon, make sure your custom theme includes and
override for both `owncloud/apps/core/img/favicon.svg` and
`owncloud/apps/core/img/favicon.png`, to cover any future updates to
favicon handling.

[[how-to-override-the-default-colors]]
How to Override the Default Colors
----------------------------------

To override the default style sheet, create a new CSS style sheet in
your theme, in the theme’s `css` directory, called `styles.css`.

[[how-to-override-translations]]
How to Override Translations
----------------------------

You can override the translation of any string in your theme. To do so:

1.  Create the `l10n` folder inside your theme, for the app that you
want to override.
2.  In the `l10n` folder, create the translation file for the language
that you want to customize.

For example, if you want to overwrite the German translation of
_``Download`_ in the files app, you would create the file
`owncloud/apps/theme-example/apps/files/l10n/de_DE.js`. Note that the
structure is the same as for images. You just mimic the original file
location inside your theme. You would then put the following code in the
file:

[source,js]
----
OC.L10N.register(
  "files",
  {
    "Download" : "Herunterladen"
  },
  "nplurals=2; plural=(n != 1);"
);
----

You then need to create a second translation file,
`owncloud/apps/theme-example/apps/files/l10n/de_DE.json`, which looks
like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "translations": {
    "Download" : "Herunterladen"
  },
  "pluralForm" :"nplurals=2; plural=(n != 1);"
}
----

Both files (`.js` and `.json`) are needed. The first is needed to enable
translations in the JavaScript code and the second one is read by the
PHP code and provides the data for translated terms.

[[how-to-override-names-slogans-and-urls]]
How to Override Names, Slogans, and URLs
----------------------------------------

In addition to translations, the ownCloud theme allows a lot of the
names that are shown on the web interface to be changed. This is done in
`defaults.php`, which needs to be located within the theme’s root
folder. You can find a sample version in
`owncloud/app/theme-example/defaults.php`. In there, you need to define
a class named `OC_Theme` and implement the methods that you want to
overwrite.

[source,php]
----
class OC_Theme {
  public function getAndroidClientUrl() {
    return 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owncloud.android';
  }

  public function getName() {
    return 'ownCloud';
  }
}
----

Each method must return a string. The following methods are available:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Method |Description
|`getAndroidClientUrl` |Returns the URL to Google Play for the Android
Client.

|`getBaseUrl` |Returns the base URL.

|`getDocBaseUrl` |Returns the documentation URL.

|`getEntity` |Returns the entity (e.g., company name) used in footers
and

| |copyright notices.

|`getName` |Returns the short name of the software.

|`getHTMLName` |Returns the short name of the software containing HTML
strings.

|`getiOSClientUrl` |Returns the URL to the ownCloud Marketplace for the
iOS Client.

|`getiTunesAppId` |Returns the AppId for the ownCloud Marketplace for
the iOS Client.

|`getLogoClaim` |Returns the logo claim.

|`getLongFooter` |Returns the long version of the footer.

|`getMailHeaderColor` |Returns the mail header color.

|`getSyncClientUrl` |Returns the URL where the sync clients are listed.

|`getTitle` |Returns the title.

|`getShortFooter` |Returns short version of the footer.

|`getSlogan` |Returns the slogan.
|=======================================================================

Only these methods are available in the templates, because we internally
wrap around hardcoded method names.

One exception is the method `buildDocLinkToKey` which gets passed in a
key as its first parameter. For core we do something like this to build
the documentation link:

[source,php]
----
public function buildDocLinkToKey($key) {
  return $this->getDocBaseUrl() . '/server/latest/go.php?to=' . $key;
}
----

[[how-to-test-a-theme]]
How to Test a Theme
-------------------

There are different options for testing themes:

* If you’re using a tool like the Inspector tools inside Mozilla you can
test out the CSS-Styles immediately inside the css-attributes, while
you’re looking at the page.
* If you have a development server, you can test out the effects in a
live environment.

[[settings-page-registration]]
Settings Page Registration
--------------------------

[[how-can-an-app-register-a-section-in-the-admin-or-personal-section]]
How Can an App Register a Section in the Admin or Personal Section?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of ownCloud 10.0, apps must register admin and personal section
settings in `info.xml`. As a result, all calls to
`OC_App::registerPersonal` and `OC_App::registerAdmin` should now be
removed. The settings panels of any apps that are still using these
calls will now be rendered in the ``Additional` section of the
dashboard .

For each panel an app wishes to register, two things are required:

1.  An update to `info.xml`
2.  A controller class

[[updating-info.xml]]
Updating info.xml
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, an entry must be added into the `<settings>` element in
`info.xml`, specifying the class name responsible for rendering the
panel. These will be loaded automatically when an app is enabled. For
example, to register an admin and a personal section would require the
following configuration..

....
<settings>
      <personal>OCA\MyApp\PersonalPanel::class</personal>
      <admin>OCA\MyApp\AdminPanel::class</admin>
</settings>
....

[[the-controller-class]]
The Controller Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, a controller class which implements the `OCP\Settings\ISettings`
interface must be created to represent the panel. Doing so enforces that
the necessary settings panel information is returned. The interface
specifies three methods:

______________
* getSectionID
* getPanel
* getPriority
______________

*getSectionID:* This method returns the identifier of the section that
this panel should be shown under. ownCloud Server comes with a
predefined list of sections which group related settings together; the
intention of which is to improve the user experience. This can be found
here in
https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/master/lib/private/Settings/SettingsManager.php#L195[this
example]:

*getPanel:* This method returns the `OCP\Template` or
`OCP\TemplateReponse` which is used to render the panel. The method may
also return `null` if the panel should not be shown to the user.

*getPriority:* An integer between 0 and 100 representing the importance
of the panel (higher is more important). Most apps should return a
value:

* between 20 and 50 for general information.
* greater than 50 for security information and notices.
* lower than 20 for tips and debug output.

Here’s an example implementation of a controller class for creating a
personal panel in the security section.

....
<?php

namespace OCA\YourApp

use OCP\Settings\ISettings;
use OCP\Template;

class PersonalPanel extends ISettings {

    const PRIORITY = 10;

    public function getSectionID() {
        return 'security';
    }

    public function getPriority() {
        return self::PRIORITY;
    }

    public function getPanel() {
        // Set the template and assign a template variable
        return (new Template('app-name', 'template-name'))->assign('var', 'value');
    }
}
....

[[create-custom-sections]]
Create Custom Sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the moment, there is no provision for apps creating their own
settings sections. This is to encourage sensible and intelligent
grouping of the settings panels which in turn should improve the overall
user experience. If you think a new section should be added to core
however, please create a PR with the appropriate changes to
`OC\Settings\SettingsManager`.
