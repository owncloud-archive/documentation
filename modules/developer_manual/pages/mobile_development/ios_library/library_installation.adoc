== Obtaining the library

The ownCloud iOS library may be obtained from the following Github
repository:

mailto:git@github.com:owncloud/ios-library.git[git@github.com:owncloud/ios-library.git]

Once obtained, this code should be compiled with Xcode 6. The Github
repository not only contains the library, ownCloud iOS library, but also
contains a sample project, OCLibraryExample, which will assist in
learning how to use the library.

== Add the library to a project

There are two methods to add this library to a project.

* Reference the headers and library binary file (`.a`) directly.
* Include the library as a subproject.

Which method to choose depends on user preference as well as whether the
source code and project file of the static library are available.

=== Reference headers and library binary files

Follow these steps if this is the desired method.

\1. Compile the ownCloud iOS library and run the project. A
`libownCloudiOS.a` file will be generated.

The following files are required:

*Library file*

* `libownCloudiOS.a` (Library)

*Library Classes*

* `OCCommunication.h` (Accessors) Import in the communication class
* `OCErrorMsg.h` (Error Messages) Import in the communication class
* `OCFileDto.h` and `OCFileDto.m` (File/Folder object) Import when using
* `readFolder` and `readFile` methods
* `OCFrameworkConstants.h` (Customize constants)

\2. Add the library file to the project. From the ``Build Phases` tab,
scroll to ``Link binary files` and select the `+' to add a library.
Select the library file.

\3. Add the path of the library header files. Under the ``Build
Settings` tab, select the target library and add the path in the
``Header Search Paths` field.

\4. Remaining in the ``Build Setting` tab, add the flag `-Obj-C` under
the ``Other Linker Flags` option.

At this stage, the library is included on your project and you can start
communicating with the ownCloud server.

[[include-the-library-as-a-subproject]]
=== Include the library as a subproject

Follow these steps if this is the desired method.

\5. Add the file `ownCloud iOS library.xcodeproj` to the project via
drag and drop.

\6. Within the project, navigate to the ``Build Phases` tab. Under the
``Target Dependencies` section, select the `+' and choose the library
target.

\7. Link the library file to the project target. Under the ``Build
Phases` tab, select the `+' under the ``Link Binary with Libraries`
section and select the library file.

\8. Add the flag `-Obj-C` to ``Other Linker Flags` under the project
target on the ``Build Settings` tab.

\9. Finally add the path of the library headers. Under the ``Build
Settings` tab, add the path under the ``Header Search Paths` option.
