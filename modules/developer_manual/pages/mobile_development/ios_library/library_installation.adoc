Library Installation
====================

[[obtaining-the-library]]
Obtaining the library
---------------------

The ownCloud iOS library may be obtained from the following Github
repository:

mailto:git@github.com:owncloud/ios-library.git[git@github.com:owncloud/ios-library.git]

Once obtained, this code should be compiled with Xcode 6. The Github
repository not only contains the library, ownCloud iOS library, but also
contains a sample project, OCLibraryExample, which will assist in
learning how to use the library.

Add the library to a project
----------------------------

There are two methods to add this library to a project.

* Reference the headers and library binary file (`.a`) directly.
* Include the library as a subproject.

Which method to choose depends on user preference as well as whether the
source code and project file of the static library are available.

Reference headers and library binary files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps if this is the desired method.

\1. Compile the ownCloud iOS library and run the project. A
`libownCloudiOS.a` file will be generated.

The following files are required:

*Library file*

* `libownCloudiOS.a` (Library)

*Library Classes*

* `OCCommunication.h` (Accessors) Import in the communication class
* `OCErrorMsg.h` (Error Messages) Import in the communication class
* `OCFileDto.h` and `OCFileDto.m` (File/Folder object) Import when using
* `readFolder` and `readFile` methods
* `OCFrameworkConstants.h` (Customize constants)

\2. Add the library file to the project. From the ``Build Phases` tab,
scroll to ``Link binary files` and select the `+' to add a library.
Select the library file.

\3. Add the path of the library header files. Under the ``Build
Settings` tab, select the target library and add the path in the
``Header Search Paths` field.

\4. Remaining in the ``Build Setting` tab, add the flag `-Obj-C` under
the ``Other Linker Flags` option.

At this stage, the library is included on your project and you can start
communicating with the ownCloud server.

Follow these steps if this is the desired method.

\5. Add the file `ownCloud iOS library.xcodeproj` to the project via
drag and drop.

\6. Within the project, navigate to the ``Build Phases` tab. Under the
``Target Dependencies` section, select the `+' and choose the library
target.

\7. Link the library file to the project target. Under the ``Build
Phases` tab, select the `+' under the ``Link Binary with Libraries`
section and select the library file.

\8. Add the flag `-Obj-C` to ``Other Linker Flags` under the project
target on the ``Build Settings` tab.

\9. Finally add the path of the library headers. Under the ``Build
Settings` tab, add the path under the ``Header Search Paths` option.
