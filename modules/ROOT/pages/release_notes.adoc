[[changes-in-10.0.8]]
Changes in 10.0.8
-----------------

Dear ownCloud administrator, please find below the changes and known
issues in ownCloud Server 10.0.8 that need your attention. You can also
read https://owncloud.org/changelog/server/[the full ownCloud Server
changelog] for further details on what has changed.

[[php-5.6-deprecation]]
PHP 5.6 deprecation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHP 5.6/7.0 active support has ended on January 19th 2017 / December 3rd
2017 and security support
https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php[will be dropped by the end
of 2018]. Many libraries used by ownCloud (including the QA-Suite
_PHPUnit_) will therefore not be maintained actively anymore which
forces ownCloud to drop support in one of the next minor server versions
as well. Please make sure to upgrade to PHP 7.1 as soon as possible. See
the
https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html#officially-recommended-supported-options[system
requirements in the ownCloud documentation].

[[personal-note-for-public-link-mail-notification]]
Personal note for public link mail notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the usability enhancements of ownCloud Server 10.0.8 is the
possibility for users to add a personal note when sending public links
via mail. When using customized mail templates it is necessary to either
adapt the shipped original template to the customizations or to add the
https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/stable10/core/templates/mail.php#L21-L25[code
block] for the personal note to customized templates in order to display
the personal note in the mail notifications.

[[new-mail-notifications-feature]]
New mail notifications feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ownCloud Server 10.0.8 introduces a new extensible notification
framework. Apart from technical changes under the hood the Notifications
app can now also send mails for all notifications that previously were
only displayed within the web interfaces (notification bell) or on the
Desktop client (notifications API) like incoming federated share or
Custom Group notifications, for example. In the _``General''_ settings
section users can configure whether they want to receive mails for all
notifications, only for those that require an action or decide not to
get notifications via mail (by default users will only receive
notifications when an action is required).

[[ldap-related-improvements]]
LDAP-related improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* When disabling or deleting user accounts in LDAP, the administrator
can choose to either _delete_ or _disable_ respective accounts in
ownCloud when executing `occ user:sync`
(`-m, --missing-account-action=MISSING-ACCOUNT-ACTION`). User accounts
that are disabled in ownCloud can now be re-enabled automatically when
running `occ user:sync` if they are enabled in LDAP. When this behavior
is desired administrators just need to add the `-r, --re-enable` option
to their cron jobs or when manually executing `occ user:sync`.
* Furthermore it is now possible to execute `occ user:sync` only for
_single_ (`-u, --uid=UID`) or _seen_ (`-s, --seenOnly`) users (users
that are present in the database and have logged in at least once).
These new options provide more granularity for administrators in terms
of managing `occ user:sync` performance.
* Another notable change in behavior of `occ user:sync` is that
administrators now have to explicitly specify the option
`-c, --showCount` to display the number of users to be synchronized.

[[new-events-for-audit-logging]]
New events for audit logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New events have been added to be used for audit logging, among others.
These include _configuration changes_ by administrators and users, _file
comments_ (_add/edit/delete_) and _updating existing public links_. When
logs are forwarded to external analyzers like Splunk, administrators can
check to add the new events. The latest version of the Auditing
extension (_admin_audit_) is required.

[[new-command-to-verify-and-repair-file-checksums]]
New command to verify and repair file checksums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With ownCloud 10 file integrity checking by computing and matching
checksums has been introduced to ensure that transferred files arrive at
their target in the exact state as their origin. In some rare cases
wrong checksums can be written to the database leading to
synchronization issues with e.g. the Desktop Client. To mitigate such
situations a new command `occ files:checksums:verify` has been
introduced. The command recalculates checksums either for all files of a
user or for files within a specified path, and compares them with the
values in the database. Naturally the command also offers an option to
repair incorrect checksum values (`-r, --repair`). Please check the
available options by executing `occ files:checksums:verify --help`.
Note: Executing this command might take some time depending on the file
count.

[[new-config-setting-to-specify-minimum-characters-for-sharing-autocomplete]]
New config setting to specify minimum characters for sharing autocomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For security reasons the default value for minimum characters to trigger
the sharing autocomplete mechanism has been set to ``4'' (previously it
was set to ``2''). This is to prevent people from easily downloading
lots of email addresses or user names by requesting their first letters
through the API. As it is a trade-off between security and usability for
some scenarios this high security level might not be desirable.
Therefore the value now is configurable via the _config.php_ option
`'user.search_min_length' => 4,`. Please check which value fits your
needs best.

[[new-option-to-granularly-configure-public-link-password-enforcement]]
New option to granularly configure public link password enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With ownCloud 10 the ''File Drop'' feature has been merged with public
link permissions. This kind of public link does not give recipients
access to any content, but it gives them the possibility to ''drop
files''. As a result, it might not always be desirable to enforce
password protection for such shares. Given that, passwords for public
links can now be enforced based on permissions (_read-only, read &
write, upload only/File Drop_). Please check the administration settings
_''Sharing''_ section and configure as desired.

[[new-option-to-exclude-apps-from-integrity-check]]
New option to exclude apps from integrity check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By verifying signature files the _integrity check_ ensures that the code
running in an ownCloud instance has not been altered by third parties.
Naturally this check can only be successful for code that has been
obtained from official ownCloud sources. When providing custom apps
(like theme apps) that do not have a signature, the integrity check will
fail and notify the administrator. These apps can now be excluded from
the _integrity check_ by using the _config.php_ option
`'integrity.ignore.missing.app.signature' => ['app_id1', 'app_id2', 'app_id3'],`.
See _config.sample.php_ for more information.

[[new-occ-command-to-modify-user-details]]
New occ command to modify user details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to modify user details like display names or mail
addresses via the command `occ user:modify`. Please append `--help` for
more information.

[[occ-filesscan-can-now-be-executed-for-groups]]
occ files:scan can now be executed for groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apart from using the `occ files:scan` command for _single users_ and
_whole instances_ it can now be executed for _groups_ using
`-g, --groups=GROUPS`. Please append `--help` for more information.

[[new-configurable-default-format-for-syslog]]
New configurable default format for syslog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using syslog as the log type (`'log_type' => 'syslog',` in
_config.php_) the default format has been changed to include _request
IDs_ for easier debugging. Additionally the log format has been made
configurable using `'log.syslog.format'` in _config.php_. If you require
a certain log format, please check the new format and
_config.sample.php_ on how to change it.

[[new-config-option-to-enable-fallback-to-http-for-federated-shares]]
New config option to enable fallback to HTTP for federated shares
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For security reasons federated sharing (sharing between different
ownCloud instances) strictly requires HTTPS (SSL/TLS). When this
behavior is undesired the insecure fallback to HTTP needs to be enabled
explicitly by setting `'sharing.federation.allowHttpFallback' => false,`
to `true` in _config.php_.

[[migration-related-to-auth_tokens-app-passwords]]
Migration related to auth_tokens (app passwords)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrading to 10.0.8 includes migrations related to _auth_tokens_ (_app
passwords_). When users have created _app passwords_ as separate
passwords for their clients the upgrade duration will increase depending
on user count. Please consider this when planning the upgrade.

[[changed-behavior-of-e-mail-autocomplete-for-public-link-share-dialog]]
Changed behavior of e-mail autocomplete for public link share dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the _``Sharing''_ settings option
`Allow users to send mail notifications for shared files` for public
links is enabled, users can send public links via mail from within the
web interface. The behavior of the autocomplete when entering mail
addresses in the public link share dialog has been changed. Previously
the autocomplete queried for local users, users from federated address
books and contacts from CardDAV/Contacts App. As public links are not
intended for sharing between ownCloud users (local/federated), those
have been removed. Contacts synchronized via CardDAV or created in the
Contacts app will still appear as suggestions.

[[notifications-sent-by-occ-can-now-include-links]]
Notifications sent by _occ_ can now include links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command `occ:notifications:generate` can be used to send
notifications to individual users or groups. With 10.0.8 it is also
capable of including links to such notifications using the
`-l, --link=LINK` option. Please append `--help` for more information.
There is also
https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/announcementcenter[Announcementcenter]
to conduct such tasks from the web interface but it is currently limited
to send notifications to all users. For now administrators can use the
_occ_ command if more granularity is required.

[[global-option-for-cors-domains]]
Global option for CORS domains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For security reasons ownCloud has a _Same-Origin-Policy_ that prevents
requests to ownCloud resources from other domains than the domain the
backend server is hosted on. If ownCloud resources should be accessible
from other domains, e.g. for a separate web frontend operated on a
different domain, administrators can now globally specify policy
exceptions via _CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)_ using
`'cors.allowed-domains'` in _config.php_. Please check
_config.sample.php_ for more information.

[[solved-known-issues]]
Solved known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Bogus ``Login failed'' log entries have been removed (see
https://doc.owncloud.com/server/10.0/admin_manual/release_notes.html#changes-in-10-0-7[10.0.7
known issues])
* The _Provisioning API_ can now properly set default or zero quota
* User quota settings can be queried through _Provisioning API_
* A regression preventing a user from setting their e-mail address in
the settings page has been fixed
* File deletion as a guest user works correctly (trash bin permissions
are checked correctly)

[[known-issues]]
Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Issues with multiple theme apps and Mail Template Editor

As of ownCloud Server 10.0.5 it is only possible to have one theme app
enabled simultaneously. When a theme app is enabled and the
administrator attempts to enable a second one this will result in an
error. However, when also having the Mail Template Editor enabled in
this scenario the administrators _``General''_ settings section
https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/31134[will be displayed
incorrectly]. As a remedy administrators can either uninstall the second
theme app or disable the Mail Template Editor app.

* `occ transfer:ownership`
https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/31150[does not transfer public
link shares if they were created by the target user (reshare)].

[[for-developers]]
For developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The global JS variable ``oc_current_user'' was removed. Please use the
public method ``OC.getCurrentUser()'' instead.
* Lots of new Symfony events have been added for various user actions,
see changelog for details. Documentation ticket:
<https://github.com/owncloud/documentation/issues/3738>`_
* When requesting a private link there is a new HTTP response header
``Webdav-Location'' that contains the Webdav path to the requested file
while the ``Location'' still points at the frontend URL for viewing the
file.

[[changes-in-10.0.7]]
Changes in 10.0.7
-----------------

ownCloud Server 10.0.7 is a hotfix follow-up release that takes care of
an https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/30157[issue regarding OAuth
authentication].

Please consider the ownCloud Server 10.0.5 release notes.

[[known-issues-1]]

-----------------

ownCloud Server 10.0.6 is a hotfix follow-up release that takes care of
an issue during the build process
(https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/30265). Please consider the
ownCloud Server 10.0.5 release notes.

[[changes-in-10.0.5]]
Changes in 10.0.5
-----------------

Dear ownCloud administrator, please find below the changes and known
issues in ownCloud Server 10.0.5 that need your attention. You can also
read https://owncloud.org/changelog/server/[the full ownCloud Server
changelog] for further details on what has changed.

[[technology-preview-for-php-7.2-support]]
Technology preview for PHP 7.2 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ownCloud catches up with new web technologies. This has mainly been
introduced for the open-source community to test and give feedback. PHP
7.2 is not yet supported nor recommended for production scenarios.
ownCloud is going to fully support PHP 7.2 with the next major release.

[[php-intl-now-is-a-hard-requirement]]
php-intl now is a hard requirement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please make sure to have the PHP extension installed before upgrading.

[[changed-only-allow-a-single-active-theme-app]]
Changed: Only allow a single active theme app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The theming behavior has been changed so that only a single theme can be
active concurrently. This change ensures that themes can not interfere
in any way (e.g., override default theming in an arbitrary order).
Please make sure to have the desired theme enabled after upgrading.

[[removed-old-dropbox-external-storage-backend-dropbox-api-v1]]
Removed old Dropbox external storage backend (Dropbox API v1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please switch to the new _External Storage: Dropbox_ app
(https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/files_external_dropbox) with
Dropbox API v2 support to continue providing Dropbox external storages
to your users.

[[fixed-only-set-cors-headers-on-webdav-endpoint-when-origin-header-is-specified]]
Fixed: Only set CORS headers on WebDAV endpoint when Origin header is specified
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ownCloud Server 10.0.4 known issue is resolved.

[[fixes-and-improvements-for-the-mail-template-editor]]
Fixes and improvements for the Mail Template Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Known issues are resolved: Mail Template Editor works again, got
support for app themes and additional templates were added for
customization.
* Mail Template Editor is still bundled with ownCloud Server but will
soon be released as a separate app to ownCloud Marketplace.
* Changelog:
https://github.com/owncloud/templateeditor/blob/release/0.2.0/CHANGELOG.md

[[known-issues-2]]
Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* When using application passwords,
https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/30157[log entries related to
``Login Failed'' will appear], please upgrade to 10.0.7 and check the
fix mentionned in its release notes.

[[changes-in-10.0.4]]
Changes in 10.0.4
-----------------

Dear ownCloud administrator, please find below the changes and known
issues in ownCloud Server 10.0.4 that need your attention. You can also
read https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/stable10/CHANGELOG.md[the
full ownCloud Server 10.0.4 changelog] for further details on what has
changed.

[[more-granular-sharing-restrictions]]
More granular sharing restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``__Restrict users to only share with users in their groups__''
option, in the Sharing settings, restricts users to only share with
groups which they are a member of, while simultaneously prohibiting
sharing with single users that do not belong to any of the users’
groups.

To make this more granular, we split this option into two parts and
added ``__Restrict users to only share with groups they are member
of__'', which differentiates between users and groups. Doing so makes it
possible to restrict users from sharing with all users of an
installation, limiting them to only being able to share with groups
which they are a member of, and vice versa.

[[configurable-solution-for-indistinguishable-user-display-names]]
Configurable solution for indistinguishable user display names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ownCloud sharing dialog displays users according to their display
name. As users can choose their display name in self-service (which can
be disabled in config.php) and display names are not unique, it is
possible that a user can’t distinguish sharing results. To cover this
case the displayed user identifiers are now configurable. In the Sharing
settings administrators can now configure the display of either mail
addresses or user ids.

[[added-occ-filesscan-repair-mode-to-repair-filecache-inconsistencies]]
Added ``occ files:scan'' repair mode to repair filecache inconsistencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend to use this command when directed to do so in the upgrade
process. Please refer to link:[the occ command’s files:scan –repair
documentation] for more information.

[[detailed-mode-for-occ-securityroutes]]
Detailed mode for ``occ security:routes''
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Administrators can use the output of this command when using a network
firewall, to check the appropriateness of configured rules or to get
assistance when setting up.

[[added-mode-of-operations-to-differentiate-between-single-instance-or-clustered-setup]]
Added mode of operations to differentiate between single-instance or clustered setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As ownCloud needs to behave differently when operating in a clustered
setup versus a single instance setup, the new config.php option
`operation.mode` has been added. It can take one of two values:
`single-instance` and `clustered-instance`. For example:
`'operation.mode' => 'clustered-instance',`.

Currently the Market App (ownCloud Marketplace integration) does not
support clustered setups and can do harm when used for installing or
updating apps. The new config setting prevents this and other actions
that are undesired in cluster mode.

*When operating in a clustered setup, it is mandatory to set this
option.* Please check
https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters.html#mode-of-operation[the
config_sample_php_parameters documentation] for more information.

[[added-occ-davcleanup-chunks-command-to-clean-up-expired-uploads]]
Added occ dav:cleanup-chunks command to clean up expired uploads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When file uploads are interrupted for any reason, already uploaded file
parts (chunks) remain in the underlying storage so that the file upload
can resume in a future upload attempt. However, resuming an upload is
only possible until the partial upload is expired and deleted,
respectively.

To clean up chunks (expire and delete) originating from unfinished
uploads, administrators can use this newly introduced command. The
default expiry time is two days, but it can be specified as a parameter
to the command. *It is recommended to configure CRON to execute this
background job regularly*.

It is not included in the regular ownCloud background jobs so that the
administrators have more flexibility in scheduling it. Please check
https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/server/background_jobs_configuration.html#cleanupchunks[the
background jobs configuration documentation] for more information.

[[administrators-can-now-exclude-files-from-integrity-check-in-config.php]]
Administrators can now exclude files from integrity check in config.php
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When administrators did intentional changes to the ownCloud code they
now have the ability to exclude certain files from the integrity
checker. Please check ``config.sample.php'' for the usage of
`'integrity.excluded.files'`.

[[modification-time-value-of-files-is-now-64-bits-long]]
Modification time value of files is now 64 bits long
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When upgrading to 10.0.4 migrations may increase update duration
dependent on number of files.

[[updated-minimum-supported-browser-versions]]
Updated minimum supported browser versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users with outdated browsers might get warnings. See
https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html#web-browser[the
list of supported browser versions].

[[known-issues-3]]
Known issues

* When using application passwords,
https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/30157[log entries related to
``Login Failed'' will appear], please upgrade to 10.0.7 and check the
fix mentioned in its release notes.

[[resolved-known-issues]]

[[changes-in-10.0.3]]
Changes in 10.0.3
-----------------

Dear ownCloud administrator, please find below the changes and known
issues of ownCloud Server 10.0.3 that need your attention:

**The full ownCloud Server 10.0.3 changelog can be found here:
https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/stable10/CHANGELOG.md**

* It is now possible to directly upgrade from 8.2.11 to 10.0.3 in a
single upgrade process.
* Added occ command to list routes which can help administrators setting
up network firewall rules.
* `occ upgrade` is now verbose by default. Administrators may need to
adjust scripts for automated setup/upgrade procedures that rely on `occ
upgrade' outputs.
* Reenabled medial search by default::
  ** Enables partial search in sharing dialog autocompletion (e.g. a
  user wants to share with the user ``Peter'': Entering ``pe'' will find
  the user, entering ``ter'' will only find the user if the option is
  enabled)
  ** New default is set to enabled as there is no performance impact
  anymore due to the introduction of the user account table in ownCloud
  Server 10.0.1.
  ** Please check the setting. You need to disable it explicitly if the
  functionality is undesired.
* All database columns that use the fileid have been changed to bigint
(64-bits). For large instances it is therefore highly recommended to
upgrade in order to avoid reaching limits.
* Upgrade and Market app information::
  ** Removed ``appstoreenabled'' setting from config.php. If you want to
  disable the app store / Marketplace integration, please disable the
  Market app.
  ** Added setting `upgrade.automatic-app-update' to config.php to
  disable automatic app updates with `occ upgrade' when Market app is
  enabled
  ** On upgrade from OC < 10 the Market app won’t be enabled if
  ``appstoreenabled'' was false in config.php.
* Clustering: Better support of read only config file and apps folder
* Default minimum desktop client version in config.php is now 2.2.4.

*Known issues*

* Added quotes in boolean result values of yourdomain/status.php output
* Setting up SFTP external storages with keypairs does not work.
https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/28669
* If you have storage encryption enabled, the web UI for encryption will
ask again what mode you want to operate with even if you already had a
mode selected before. The administrator must select the mode they had
selected before. https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/28985
* Uploading a folder in Chrome in a way that would overwrite an existing
folder can randomly fail (race conditions).
https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/28844
* Federated shares can not be accepted in WebUI for SAML/Shibboleth
users
* For *MariaDB users*: Currently, Doctrine has no support for the
breaking changes introduced in MariaDB 10.2.7, and above. If you are on
MariaDB 10.2.7 or above, and have encountered the message ``1067 Invalid
default value for `lastmodified''',
https://gist.github.com/VicDeo/bb0689104baeb5ad2371d3fdb1a013ac/raw/04bb98e08719a04322ea883bcce7c3e778e3afe1/DoctrineMariaDB102.patch[please
apply this patch] to Doctrine. We expect this bug to be fixed in
ownCloud 10.0.4. For more information on the bug,
https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/28695[check out the related
issue].
* When updating from ownCloud < 9.0 the CLI output may hang for some
time (potentially up to 20 minutes for big instances) whilst sharing is
updated. This can happen in a variety of places during the upgrade and
is to be expected. Please be patient as the update is performed and the
output will continue as normal.

[[changes-in-10.0.1]]
Changes in 10.0.1
-----------------

Hello ownCloud administrator, please read carefully to be prepared for
updates and operations of your ownCloud setup.

* *A new update path:* ownCloud 10.0.1 contains migration logic to allow
upgrading directly from 9.0 to 10.0.1.
* *Marketplace:* Please create an account for
https://marketplace.owncloud.com[the new marketplace]. Access to
optional ownCloud extensions and enterprise apps will be provided by the
marketplace from now on. Currently some apps are still shipped with the
tarballs / packages and will be moved to the marketplace in the near
future.
* *Apps:* _LDAP_, _gallery_, _activity_, _PDF viewer_, and _text editor_
were moved to the marketplace.
* *Updates with marketplace:* During the upgrade, enabled apps are also
updated by fetching new versions directly from the marketplace. If
during an update, sources for some apps are missing, and the ownCloud
instance has no access to the marketplace, the administrator needs to
disable these apps or manually download and provide the apps before
updating.
* *App updates:* Third party apps are not disabled anymore when
upgrading.
* *Upgrade migration test:* The upgrade migration test has been removed;
see migration_test_label. (Option `--skip-migration-tests` removed from
update command).

The template editor app is not included in the 10.0.1 release due to
technical reasons, but will be distributed via the marketplace. However,
you can still
edit template files manually <using_email_templates_label>.

[[settings]]
Settings
~~~~~~~~

* *Settings design:* Admin, personal pages, and app management are now
merged together into a single ``Settings'' entry.
* *Disable users:* The ability to disable users in the user management
panel has been added.
* *Password Policy:* Rules now apply not only to link passwords but also
to user passwords.

[[infrastructure]]
Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* *Client:* You need to update to
https://doc.owncloud.com/desktop/latest/[the latest desktop client
version].
* *Cron jobs:* The user account table has been reworked. As a result the
Cron job for
link:configuration/server/occ_command.html#syncing-user-accounts[syncing
user backends], e.g., LDAP, needs to be configured.
* *Logfiles:* App logs, e.g., auditing and owncloud.log, can now be

[[converting-the-database-type-doesnt-work]]
Converting the Database Type doesn’t work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Converting a Database from e.g. `SQLite` to `MySQL` or `PostgreSQL` with
the `occ db:convert-type` currently doesn’t work. See
https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/27075 for more info.

[[installing-the-ldap-user-backend-will-trigger-the-installation-twice]]
Installing the LDAP user backend will trigger the installation twice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This causes an SQL error such as the following:

[source,console]
----
sudo -u www-data ./occ market:install user_ldap

user_ldap: Installing new app ...
user_ldap: An exception occurred while executing 'CREATE TABLE `ldap_user_mapping` (`ldap_dn` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL, `owncloud_name` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL, `directory_uuid` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL, UNIQUE INDEX ldap_dn_users (`ldap_dn`), PRIMARY KEY(`owncloud_name`)) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin ENGINE = InnoDB ROW_FORMAT = compressed':

SQLSTATE[42S01]: Base table or view already exists: 1050 Table 'ldap_user_mapping' already exists
----

This can be safely ignored. And the app can be used after enabling it.
Please be aware that when upgrading an existing ownCloud installation
that already has `user_ldap` this error will not occur. It was fixed by
https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/27982. However, this could happen
for other apps as well that use `database.xml`. If it does please use
the same workaround.

[[saml-authentication-only-works-for-users-synced-with-occ-usersync]]
SAML authentication only works for users synced with `occ user:sync`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will re-enable SSO for LDAP users with an update of the app in the
market after completing internal testing.

[[the-web-ui-prevents-uninstalling-apps-marked-as-shipped-e.g.-user_ldap]]
The web UI prevents uninstalling apps marked as shipped, e.g., `user_ldap`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To uninstall, disable the app with occ and rm the app directory.

[[moving-files-around-in-external-storages-outside-of-owncloud-will-invalidate-the-metadata]]
Moving files around in external storages outside of ownCloud will invalidate the metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All shares, comments, and tags on the moved files will be lost.

[[existing-ldap-users-only-show-up-in-the-user-management-page-and-the-share-dialog-after-being-synced]]
Existing LDAP users only show up in the user management page and the share dialog after being synced
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The account table introduced in ownCloud 10.0.0 significantly reduces
LDAP communication overhead. Password checks are yet to be accounted
for. LDAP user metadata in the account table will be updated when users
log in or when the administrator runs
`occ user:sync "OCA\User_LDAP\User_Proxy"`. We recommend
setting up a nightly Cron job <cron_job_label> to keep metadata of users
not actively logging in up to date.

[[error-pages-will-not-use-the-configured-theme-but-will-instead-fall-back-to-the-community-default]]
Error pages will not use the configured theme but will instead fall back to the community default
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[changes-in-10.0.0]]
Changes in 10.0.0
-----------------

* PHP 7.1 support added (supported PHP versions are 5.6 and 7.0+)
* The upgrade migration test has been removed; see migration_test_label.
(Option `"--skip-migration-tests"` removed from update command)
* Requires to use the latest desktop client version 2.3
* Third party apps are not disabled anymore when upgrading
* User account table has been reworked. CRON job for syncing with e.g.
LDAP needs to be configured (see
https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/server/occ_command.html#syncing-user-accounts)
* LDAP app is not released with ownCloud 10.0.0 and will be released on
the marketplace after some more QA
* files_drop app is not shipped anymore as it’s integrated with core
now. Since migrations are not possible you will have to reconfigure your
drop folders (in the `Public Link' section of the sharing dialog of the
respective folders).
* SAML/Shibboleth with device-specific app passwords: No migration
possible; Users need to regenerate device-specific app passwords in the
WebUI and enter those in their clients.
* For security reasons status.php can now be configured in config.php to
not return server version information anymore (`version.hide'; default
`false'). As clients still depend on version information this is not yet
recommended. The default will change to `true' with 10.0.2 once clients
are ready.
* Order of owncloud.log entries changed a bit, please review any
application (e.g. fail2ban rules) relying on this file
* External storages::
  ** FTP external storage moved to a separate app
  (https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/files_external_ftp)
  ** ``Local'' storage type can now be disabled by sysadmin in
  config.php (to prevent users mounting the local file system)

Full changelog:
https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/ownCloud-10.0-Features

[[changes-in-9.1]]
Changes in 9.1
--------------

*General*

* Background jobs (cron) can now run in parallel
* Update notifications in client via API - You can now be notified in
your desktop client about available updates for core and apps. The
notifications are made available via the notifications API.
* Multi-bucket support for primary objectstore integration
* Support for Internet Explorer below version 11 was dropped
* Symlinks pointing outside of the data directory are disallowed. Please
use the configuration/files/external_storage_configuration_gui with the
configuration/files/external_storage/local storage backend instead.
* Removed `dav:migrate-calendars` and `dav:migrate-addressbooks`
commands for `occ`. Users planning to upgrade from ownCloud 9.0 or below
to ownCloud 9.1 needs to make sure that their calendars and address
books are correctly migrated *before* continuing to upgrade to 9.1.

*Authentication*

* Pluggable authentication: plugin system that supports different
authentication schemes
* Token-based authentication
* Ability to invalidate sessions
* List connected browsers/devices in the personal settings page. Allows
the user to disconnect browsers/devices.
* Device-specific passwords/tokens, can be generated in the personal
page and revoked
* Disable users and automatically revoke their sessions
* Detect disabled LDAP users or password changes and revoke their
sessions
* Log in with email address
* Configuration option to enforce token-based login outside the web UI
* Two Factor authentication plug-in system
* OCC command added to (temporarily) disable/enable two-factor
authentication for single users

The current desktop and mobile client versions do not support two-factor
yet, this will be added later. It is already possible to generate a
device specific password and enter that in the current client versions.

*Files app*

* Ability to toggle displaying hidden files
* Remember sort order
* Permalinks for internal shares
* Visual cue when dragging in files app
* Autoscroll file list when dragging files
* Upload progress estimate

*Federated sharing*

* Ability to create federated shares with CRUDS permissions
* Resharing a federated share does not create a chain of shares any more
but connects the share owner’s server to the reshare recipient

*External storage*

* UTF-8 NFD encoding compatibility support for NFD file names stored
directly on external storages (new mount option in external storage
admin page)
* Direct links to the configuration pages for setting up a GDrive or
Dropbox application for use with ownCloud
* Some performance and memory usage improvements for GDrive, stream
download and chunk upload
* Performance and memory usage improvements for Dropbox with stream
download
* GDrive library update provides exponential backoff which will reduce
rate limit errors

*Shibboleth*

* The WebDAV endpoint was changed from `/remote.php/webdav` to
`/remote.php/dav`. You need to check your Apache configuration if you
have exceptions or rules for WebDAV configured.

*Minor additions*

* Support for print style sheets
* Command line based update will now be suggested if the instance is
bigger to avoid potential timeouts
* Web updater will be disabled if LDAP or shibboleth are installed
* DB/application update process now shows better progress information
* Added `occ files:scan --unscanned` to only scan folders that haven’t
yet been explored on external storages
* Chunk cache TTL can now be configured
* Added warning for wrongly configured database transactions, helps
prevent ``database is locked'' issues
* Use a capped memory cache to reduce memory usage especially in
background jobs and the file scanner
* Allow login by email
* Respect CLASS property in calendar events
* Allow addressbook export using VCFExportPlugin
* Birthdays are also generated based on shared addressbooks

*For developers*

* New DAV endpoint with a new chunking protocol aiming to solve many
issues like timeouts (not used by clients yet)
* New webdav property for share permissions
* Background repair steps can be specified info.xml
* Background jobs (cron) can now be declared in info.xml
* Apps can now define repair steps to run at install/uninstall time
* Export contact images via Sabre DAV plugin
* Sabre DAV’s browser plugin is available in debug mode to allow easier
development around webdav

*Technical debt*

* PSR-4 autoloading forced for `OC\` and `OCP\`, optional for `OCA\`
docs at
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/developer_manual/app/classloader.html
* More cleanup of the sharing code (ongoing)

[[changes-in-9.0]]
Changes in 9.0
--------------

9.0 requires .ico files for favicons. This will change in 9.1, which
will use .svg files. See
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/developer_manual/core/theming.html#changing-favicon[Changing
favicon] in the Developer Manual.

Home folder rule is enforced in the user_ldap application in new
ownCloud installations; see configuration/user/user_auth_ldap. This
affects ownCloud 8.0.10, 8.1.5 and 8.2.0 and up.

The Calendar and Contacts apps have been rewritten and the CalDAV and
CardDAV backends of these apps were merged into ownCloud core. During
the upgrade existing Calendars and Addressbooks are automatically
migrated (except when using the `IMAP user backend`). As a fallback for
failed upgrades, when using the `IMAP user backend` or as an option to
test a migration `dav:migrate-calendars` and/or
`dav:migrate-addressbooks` scripts are available (*only in ownCloud
9.0*) via the `occ` command. See configuration/server/occ_command.

After upgrading to ownCloud 9.0 and *before* continuing to upgrade to
9.1 make sure that all of your and your users Calendars and Addressbooks
are migrated correctly. Especially when using the `IMAP user backend`
(other user backends might be also affected) you need to manually run
the mentioned `occ` migration commands described above.

Updates on systems with large datasets will take longer, due to the
addition of checksums to the ownCloud database. See
https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/22747.

Linux packages are available from our
https://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/stable/owncloud/[official
download repository] . New in 9.0: split packages. `owncloud` installs
ownCloud plus dependencies, including Apache and PHP. `owncloud-files`
installs only ownCloud. This is useful for custom LAMP stacks, and
allows you to install your own LAMP apps and versions without packaging
conflicts with ownCloud. See installation/linux_installation.

New option for the ownCloud admin to enable or disable sharing on
individual external mountpoints (see
external_storage_mount_options_label). Sharing on such mountpoints is
disabled by default.

[[enterprise-9.0]]
Enterprise 9.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

owncloud-enterprise packages are no longer available for CentOS 6,
RHEL6, Debian 7, or any version of Fedora. A new package,
owncloud-enterprise-files, is available for all supported platforms,
including the above. This new package comes without dependencies, and is
installable on a larger number of platforms. System administrators must
install their own LAMP stacks and databases. See
https://owncloud.org/blog/time-to-upgrade-to-owncloud-9-0/

[[changes-in-8.2]]
Changes in 8.2
--------------

New location for Linux package repositories; ownCloud admins must
manually change to the new repos. See maintenance/upgrade

PHP 5.6.11+ breaks the LDAP wizard with a `Could not connect to LDAP'
error. See https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/20020.

`filesystem_check_changes` in `config.php` is set to 0 by default. This
prevents unnecessary update checks and improves performance. If you are
using external storage mounts such as NFS on a remote storage server,
set this to 1 so that ownCloud will detect remote file changes.

XSendFile support has been removed, so there is no longer support for
link:[serving static files
<https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/files/
serving_static_files_configuration.html>] from your ownCloud server.

LDAP issue: 8.2 uses the `memberof` attribute by default. If this is not
activated on your LDAP server your user groups will not be detected, and
you will see this message in your ownCloud log:
`Error PHP Array to string  conversion at /var/www/html/owncloud/lib/private/template/functions.php#36`.
Fix this by disabling the `memberof` attribute on your ownCloud server
with the `occ` command, like this example on Ubuntu Linux:

....
sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:set-config "s01" useMemberOfToDetectMembership 0
....

Run `sudo -u www-data php occ ldap:show-config` to find the correct
`sNN` value; if there is not one then use empty quotes, `""`. (See
configuration/server/occ_command.)

Users of the Linux Package need to update their repository setup as
described in this
https://owncloud.org/blog/upgrading-to-owncloud-server-8-2/[blogpost].

[[changes-in-8.1]]
Changes in 8.1
--------------

Use APCu only if available in version 4.0.6 and higher. If you install
an older version, you will see a
`APCu below version 4.0.6 is installed, for stability and performance reasons we recommend to update to a newer APCu version`
warning on your ownCloud admin page.

SMB external storage now based on `php5-libsmbclient`, which must be
downloaded from the ownCloud software repositories (link:[installation
instructions
<https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=isv%3AownCloud%3Acommunity%
3A8.1&package=php5-libsmbclient>]).

``Download from link'' feature has been removed.

The `.htaccess` and `index.html` files in the `data/` directory are now
updated after every update. If you make any modifications to these files
they will be lost after updates.

The SabreDAV browser at `/remote.php/webdav` has been removed.

Using ownCloud without a `trusted_domain` configuration will not work
anymore.

The logging format for failed logins has changed and considers now the
proxy configuration in `config.php`.

A default set of security and privacy HTTP headers have been added to
the ownCloud `.htaccess` file, and ownCloud administrators may now
customize which headers are sent.

More strict SSL certificate checking improves security but can result in
``cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer
certificate'' errors with certain broken PHP versions. Please verify
your SSL setup, update your PHP or contact your vendor if you receive
these errors.

The persistent file-based cache (e.g. used by LDAP integration) has been
dropped and replaced with a memory-only cache, which must be explicitly
configured. See configuration/user/user_auth_ldap. Memory cache
configuration for the ownCloud server is no longer automatic, requiring
installation of your desired cache backend and configuration in
`config.php` (see configuration/server/caching_configuration.)

The `OC_User_HTTP` backend has been removed. Administrators are
encouraged to use the `user_webdavauth` application instead.

ownCloud ships now with its own root certificate bundle derived from
Mozilla’s root certificates file. The system root certificate bundle
will not be used anymore for most requests.

When you upgrade from ownCloud 8.0, with encryption enabled, to 8.1, you
must enable the new encryption backend and migrate your encryption keys.
See upgrading_encryption_label.

Encryption can no longer be disabled in ownCloud 8.1. It is planned to
re-add this feature to the command line client for a future release.

It is not recommended to upgrade encryption-enabled systems from
ownCloud Server 8.0 to version 8.1.0 as there is a chance the migration
will break. We recommend migrating to the first bugfix release, ownCloud
Server 8.1.1.

Due to various technical issues, by default desktop sync clients older
than 1.7 are not allowed to connect and sync with the ownCloud server.
This is configurable via the `minimum.supported.desktop.version` switch
in `config.php`.

Previews are now generated at a maximum size of 2048 x 2048 pixels. This
is configurable via the `preview_max_x` and `preview_max_y` switches in
`config.php`.

The ownCloud 8 server is not supported on any version of Windows.

The 8.1.0 release has a minor bug which makes application updates fail
at first try. Reload the apps page and try again, and the update will
succeed.

The `forcessl` option within the `config.php` and the `Enforce SSL`
option within the Admin-Backend was removed. This now needs to be
configured like described in use_https_label.

WebDAV file locking was removed in ownCloud 8.1 which causes Finder on
Mac OS X to mount WebDAV read-only.

[[enterprise-8.1]]
Enterprise 8.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SharePoint Drive application does not verify the SSL certificate of
the SharePoint server or the ownCloud server, as it is expected that
both devices are in the same trusted environment.

[[changes-in-8.0]]
Changes in 8.0
--------------

[[manual-ldap-port-configuration]]
Manual LDAP Port Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are configuring the LDAP user and group backend application,
ownCloud may not auto-detect the LDAP server’s port number, so you will
need to enter it manually.

[[no-preview-icon-on-text-files]]
No Preview Icon on Text Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no preview icon displayed for text files when the file contains
fewer than six characters.

[[remote-federated-cloud-share-cannot-be-reshared-with-local-users]]
Remote Federated Cloud Share Cannot be Reshared With Local Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you mount a Federated Cloud share from a remote ownCloud server,
you cannot re-share it with your local ownCloud users. (See
configuration/files/federated_cloud_sharing_configuration to learn more
about federated cloud sharing)

[[manually-migrate-encryption-keys-after-upgrade]]
Manually Migrate Encryption Keys after Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using the Encryption application and upgrading from older
versions of ownCloud to ownCloud 8.0, you must manually migrate your
encryption keys. See upgrading_encryption_label.

[[windows-server-not-supported]]
Windows Server Not Supported
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows Server is not supported in ownCloud 8.

[[php-5.3-support-dropped]]
PHP 5.3 Support Dropped
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHP 5.3 is not supported in ownCloud 8, and PHP 5.4 or better is
required.

[[disable-apache-multiviews]]
Disable Apache Multiviews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Multiviews are enabled in your Apache configuration, this may cause
problems with content negotiation, so disable Multiviews by removing it
from your Apache configuration. Look for lines like this:

....
<Directory /var/www/owncloud>
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Multiviews
....

Delete `Multiviews` and restart Apache.

[[owncloud-does-not-follow-symlinks]]
ownCloud Does Not Follow Symlinks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ownCloud’s file scanner does not follow symlinks, which could lead to
infinite loops. To avoid this do not use soft or hard links in your
ownCloud data directory.

[[no-commas-in-group-names]]
No Commas in Group Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating an ownCloud group with a comma in the group name causes
ownCloud to treat the group as two groups.

[[hebrew-file-names-too-large-on-windows]]
Hebrew File Names Too Large on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Windows servers Hebrew file names grow to five times their original
size after being translated to Unicode.

[[google-drive-large-files-fail-with-500-error]]
Google Drive Large Files Fail with 500 Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Google Drive tries to download the entire file into memory, then write
it to a temp file, and then stream it to the client, so very large file
downloads from Google Drive may fail with a 500 internal server error.

[[encrypting-large-numbers-of-files]]
Encrypting Large Numbers of Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you activate the Encryption application on a running server that
has large numbers of files, it is possible that you will experience
timeouts. It is best to activate encryption at installation, before
accumulating large numbers of files on your ownCloud server.

[[enterprise-8.0]]
Enterprise 8.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[sharepoint-drive-ssl-not-verified]]
Sharepoint Drive SSL Not Verified
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SharePoint Drive application does not verify the SSL certificate of
the SharePoint server or the ownCloud server, as it is expected that
both devices are in the same trusted environment.

[[no-federated-cloud-sharing-with-shibboleth]]
No Federated Cloud Sharing with Shibboleth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Federated Cloud Sharing (formerly Server-to-Server file sharing)does not
work with Shibboleth .

[[direct-uploads-to-swift-do-not-appear-in-owncloud]]
Direct Uploads to SWIFT do not Appear in ownCloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When files are uploaded directly to a SWIFT share mounted as external
storage in ownCloud, the files do not appear in ownCloud. However, files
uploaded to the SWIFT mount through ownCloud are listed correctly in
both locations.

[[swift-objectstore-incompatible-with-encryption-app]]
SWIFT Objectstore Incompatible with Encryption App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current SWIFT implementation is incompatible with any application
that uses direct file I/O and circumvents the ownCloud virtual
filesystem. Using the Encryption application on a SWIFT object store
incurs twice as many HTTP requests and increases latency significantly.

[[application-store-is-back]]
application Store is Back
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ownCloud application Store has been re-enabled in ownCloud 8. Note
that third-party apps are not supported.

[[changes-in-7.0]]
Changes in 7.0
--------------

[[manual-ldap-port-configuration-1]]
Manual LDAP Port Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are configuring the LDAP user and group backend application,
ownCloud may not auto-detect the LDAP server’s port number, so you will
need to enter it manually.

[[ldap-search-performance-improved]]
LDAP Search Performance Improved
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to 7.0.4, LDAP searches were substring-based and would match
search attributes if the substring occurred anywhere in the attribute
value. Rather, searches are performed on beginning attributes. With
7.0.4, searches will match at the beginning of the attribute value only.
This provides better performance and a better user experience.

Substring searches can still be performed by prepending the search term
with ``*''.For example, a search for `te` will find Terri, but not Nate:

....
occ ldap:search "te"
....

If you want to broaden the search to include Nate, then search for
`*te`:

....
occ ldap:search "*te"
....

Refine searches by adjusting the `User Search Attributes` field of the
Advanced tab in your LDAP configuration on the Admin page. For example,
if your search attributes are `givenName` and `sn` you can find users by
first name + last name very quickly. For example, you’ll find Terri
Hanson by searching for `te ha`. Trailing whitespaces are ignored.

[[protecting-owncloud-on-iis-from-data-loss]]
Protecting ownCloud on IIS from Data Loss
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under certain circumstances, running your ownCloud server on IIS could
be at risk of data loss. To prevent this, follow these steps.

* In your ownCloud server configuration file,
`owncloud\config\config.php`, set `config_is_read_only` to true.
* Set the `config.php` file to read-only.
* When you make server updates `config.php` must be made writeable. When
your updates are completed re-set it to read-only.

[[antivirus-application-modes]]
Antivirus Application Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Antivirus application offers three modes for running the ClamAV
anti-virus scanner: as a daemon on the ownCloud server, a daemon on a
remote server, or an executable mode that calls `clamscan` on the local
server. We recommend using one of the daemon modes, as they are the most
reliable.

[[enable-only-for-specific-groups-fails]]
``Enable Only for Specific Groups'' Fails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some ownCloud applications have the option to be enabled only for
certain groups. However, when you select specific groups they do not get
access to the app.

[[changes-to-file-previews]]
Changes to File Previews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For security and performance reasons, file previews are available only
for image files, covers of MP3 files, and text files, and have been
disabled for all other filetypes. Files without previews are represented
by generic icons according to their file types.

[[gb-limit-on-sftp-transfers]]
4GB Limit on SFTP Transfers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because of limitations in `phpseclib`, you cannot upload files larger
than 4GB over SFTP.

[[not-enough-space-available-on-file-upload]]
``Not Enough Space Available'' on File Upload
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting user quotas to `unlimited` on an ownCloud installation that has
unreliable free disk space reporting– for example, on a shared hosting
provider– may cause file uploads to fail with a ``Not Enough Space
Available'' error. A workaround is to set file quotas for all users
instead of `unlimited`.

[[no-more-expiration-date-on-local-shares]]
No More Expiration Date On Local Shares
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In older versions of ownCloud, you could set an expiration date on both
local and public shares. Now you can set an expiration date only on
public shares, and local shares do not expire when public shares expire.

[[zero-quota-not-read-only]]
Zero Quota Not Read-Only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting a user’s storage quota should be the equivalent of read-only,
however, users can still create empty files.

[[enterprise-7.0]]
Enterprise 7.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[no-federated-cloud-sharing-with-shibboleth-1]]
No Federated Cloud Sharing with Shibboleth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Federated Cloud Sharing (formerly Server-to-Server file sharing) does
not work with Shibboleth .

[[windows-network-drive]]
Windows Network Drive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Windows Network Drive runs only on Linux servers because it requires the
Samba client, which is included in all Linux distributions.

`php5-libsmbclient` is also required, and there may be issues with older
versions of `libsmbclient`; see Using External Storage > Installing and
Configuring the Windows Network Drive application in the Enterprise
Admin manual for more information.

By default CentOS has activated SELinux, and the `httpd` process can not
make outgoing network connections. This will cause problems with curl,
LDAP and samba libraries. Again, see Using External Storage > Installing
and Configuring the Windows Network Drive application in the Enterprise
Admin manual for instructions.

[[sharepoint-drive-ssl]]
Sharepoint Drive SSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SharePoint Drive application does not verify the SSL certificate of
the SharePoint server or the ownCloud server, as it is expected that
both devices are in the same trusted environment.

[[shibboleth-and-webdav-incompatible]]
Shibboleth and WebDAV Incompatible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Shibboleth and standard WebDAV are incompatible, and cannot be used
together in ownCloud. If Shibboleth is enabled, the ownCloud client uses
an extended WebDAV protocol

[[no-sqlite]]
No SQLite
^^^^^^^^^

SQLite is no longer an installation option for ownCloud Enterprise
Edition, as it not suitable for multiple-user installations or managing
large numbers of files.

[[no-application-store]]
No Application Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The application Store is disabled for the Enterprise Edition.

[[ldap-home-connector-linux-only]]
LDAP Home Connector Linux Only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The LDAP Home Connector application requires Linux (with MySQL, MariaDB,
or PostgreSQL) to operate correctly.
