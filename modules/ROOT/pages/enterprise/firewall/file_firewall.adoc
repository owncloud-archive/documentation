File Firewall
=============

The File Firewall GUI enables you to manage firewall rule sets. You can
find it in your ownCloud admin page, under `Admin -> Security`. The File
Firewall lets you control access and sharing in fine detail, by creating
rules for allowing or denying access restrictions based on: _group_,
_upload size_, _client devices_, _IP address_, _time of day_, as well as
many more criteria. In addition to these restriction options, the File
Firewall app also supports rules based on
http://www.regular-expressions.info/[regular expressions].

[[how-the-file-firewall-works]]
How the File Firewall Works
---------------------------

Each firewall rule set consists of one or more conditions. If a request
matches all of the conditions, in at least one rule set, then the
request is blocked by the firewall. Otherwise, the request is allowed by
the firewall.

The File Firewall app cannot lock out administrators from the web
interface when rules are misconfigured.

Using the File Firewall
-----------------------

Figure 1 shows an empty firewall configuration panel. Set your logging
level to *Blocked Requests Only* for debugging, and create a new rule
set by clicking the *Add Group* button. After setting up your rules you
must click the *Save Rules* button.

panel]

Figure 2 shows two rules. The first rule, *No Support outside office
hours*, prevents members of the support group from logging into the
ownCloud Web interface from 5pm-9am, and also blocks client syncing. The
second rule prevents members of the ``qa-team'' group from accessing the
Web UI from IP addresses that are outside of the local network.

logins per user group]

All other users are not affected, and can log in anytime from anywhere.

[[available-conditions]]
Available Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[user-group]]
User Group
^^^^^^^^^^

The user (is|is not) a member of the selected group.

[[user-agent]]
User Agent
^^^^^^^^^^

The User-Agent of the request (matches|does not match) the given string.

[[user-device]]
User Device
^^^^^^^^^^^

A shortcut for matching all known (`android` | `ios` | `desktop`) sync
clients by their User Agent string.

[[request-time]]
Request Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The time of the request (has to|must not) be in a single range from
beginning time to end time.

[[request-url]]
Request URL
^^^^^^^^^^^

The *full page URL* (has tocontainend) with a given string.

[[request-type]]
Request Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The request (ispublic share link|other) request.

[[request-ip-range-ipv4-and-ip-range-ipv6]]
Request IP Range (IPv4) and IP Range (IPv6)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The request’s `REMOTE_ADDR` header (is|is not) matching the given IP
range.

[[file-size-upload]]
File Size Upload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a file is uploaded the size has to be (lessgreater|greater or
equal) to the given size.

[[file-mimetype-upload]]
File Mimetype Upload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a file is uploaded the mimetype (isbegins withends with|does not
end with) the given string.

[[system-file-tag]]
System File Tag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the parent folders or the file itself (is|is not) tagged with a
System tag.

[[regular-expression]]
Regular Expression
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The File Firewall supports regular expressions, allowing you to create
custom rules using the following conditions:

* IP Range (IPv4)
* IP Range (IPv6)
* User agent
* User group
* Request URL

You can combine multiple rules into one rule, e.g., if a rule applies to
both the support and the qa-team you could write your rule like this:

[source,text]
----
Regular Expression > ^(support|qa-team)$ > is > User group
----

We do not recommend modifying the configuration values directly in your
`config.php`. These use JSON encoding, so the values are difficult to
read and a single typo will break all of your rules.

[[controlling-access-to-folders]]
Controlling Access to Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to block access to a folder, starting with ownCloud 9.0,
is to use a system tag. A new rule type was added which allows you to
block access to files and folders, where at least one of the parents has
a given tag.

Now you just need to add the tag to the folder or file, and then block
the tag with the File Firewall. This example blocks access to any folder
with the tag ``Confidential'' from outside access.

Block by System Tag:

....
System file tag:   is       "Confidential"
IP Range (IPv4):   is not   "192.168.1.0/24"
....

[[custom-configuration-for-branded-clients]]
Custom Configuration for Branded Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using branded ownCloud clients <../clients/index>, you may
define `firewall.branded_clients` in your `config.php` to identify your
branded clients in the firewall *``User Device''* rule.

The configuration is a `User-Agent` => `Device` map. `Device` must be
one of the following:

* android
* android_branded
* ios
* ios_branded
* desktop
* desktop_branded

The `User-Agent` is always compared all lowercase. By default the agent
is compared with `equals`. When a trailing or leading asterisk, `*`, is
found, the agent is compared with `starts with` or `ends with`. If the
agent has both a leading and a trailing `*`, the string must appear
anywhere. For technical reasons the `User-Agent` string must be at least
4 characters, including wildcards. When you build your branded client
you have the option to create a custom User Agent.

In this example configuration you need to replace the example User Agent
strings, for example `'android_branded'`, with your own User Agent
strings:

....
// config.php

'firewall.branded_clients' => array(
  'my ownbrander android user agent string' => 'android_branded',
  'my ownbrander second android user agent string' => 'android_branded',
  'my ownbrander ios user agent string' => 'ios_branded',
  'my ownbrander second ios user agent string' => 'ios_branded',
  'my ownbrander desktop user agent string' => 'desktop_branded',
  'my ownbrander second desktop user agent string' => 'desktop_branded',
),
....

The Web UI dropdown then expands to the following options:

* Android Client - always visible
* iOS Client - always visible
* Desktop Client - always visible
* Android Client (Branded) - visible when at least one `android_branded`
is defined
* iOS Client (Branded) - visible when at least one `ios_branded` is
defined
* Desktop Client (Branded) - visible when at least one `desktop_branded`
is defined
* All branded clients - visible when at least one of `android_branded`,
`ios_branded` or `desktop_branded` is defined
* All non-branded clients - visible when at least one of
`android_branded`, `ios_branded` or `desktop_branded` is defined
* Others (Browsers, etc.) - always visible

Then these options operate this way:

* The `* Client` options only match `android`, `ios` and `desktop`
respectively.
* The `* Client (Branded)` options match the `*_branded` agents
equivalent.
* `All branded clients` matches: `android_branded`, `ios_branded` and
`desktop_branded`
* `All non-branded clients` matches: `android`, `ios` and `desktop`
