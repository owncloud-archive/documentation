Ransomware Protection
=====================

Ransomware is
https://www.google.de/search?q=ransomware&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiqmvL9rdfXAhWCyaQKHSkgDosQ_AUICigB&biw=1680&bih=908[an
ever-present threat], both for large enterprises as well as for
individuals. Once infected, a whole hard disk (or just parts of it) can
become encrypted, leading to unrecoverable data loss.

Once this happens, attackers usually ask victims to pay a ransom, often
via cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, in exchange for the decryption key
required to decrypt their data.

While paying the ransom works in some cases, it is not recommended, as
there is no guarantee that the attackers will supply the key after
payment is made. To help mitigate such threats and ensure ongoing access
to user data, ownCloud provides the Ransomware Protection app.

It is essential to be aware that user data needs to be synchronized with
you ownCloud Server using the ownCloud Desktop synchronization client.
Data that is not synchronized and stored in ownCloud cannot be
protected.

[[about-ransomware-protection]]
About Ransomware Protection
---------------------------

The app is tasked with _detecting_, _preventing_, and _reverting_
anomalies. Anomalies are file operations (including _create_, _update_,
_delete_, and _move_) not intentionally conducted by the user. It aims
to do so in two ways: link:ransomware_prevention_label[prevention], and
link:ransomware_protection_label[protection].

[[prevention-blocking-common-ransomware-file-extensions]]
Prevention: Blocking Common Ransomware File Extensions
------------------------------------------------------

Like other forms of cyberattack, ransomware has a range of diverse
characteristics. On the one hand it makes them hard to detect and on the
other it makes them even harder to prevent. Recent ransomware attacks
either encrypt a user’s files and add a specific file extension to them
(e.g., ``.crypt''), or they replace the original files with an encrypted
copy and add a particular file extension.

[[file-extension-blacklist]]
File Extension Blacklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first line of defense against such threats is a blacklist that
blocks write access to file extensions known to originate from
ransomware.

Ransomware Protection ships with https://fsrm.experiant.ca[a static
extension list] of around 1,500 file extensions. As new extensions are
regularly created, this list also needs to be regularly reviewed and
updated. Future releases of Ransomware Protection will include an
updated list and the ability to update the list via syncing with
https://fsrm.experiant.ca/api/v1/combined[FSRM’s API] by using
occ <../../configuration/server/occ_command>.

Please check the provided ransomware blacklist! It is *strongly
recommended* to check the provided ransomware blacklist to ensure that
it fits your needs. In some cases, the patterns might be too generic and
result in false positives.

[[file-blocking]]
File Blocking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second line of defense is file blocking. As files are uploaded, they
are compared against the file extension blacklist. If a match is found,
the upload is denied.

File blocking is always enabled.

[[account-locking]]
Account Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The third line of defense is account locking. If a client uploads a file
matching a pattern in the ransomware blacklist, the account is locked
(set as read-only) for client access (_create_, _change_, _move_, and
_delete_ operations). Doing this prevents further, malicious, changes.

Following this, clients receive an error (403 Access Forbidden) which
notifies the user that the account is locked by Ransomware Protection.

Write access (e.g., moving and deleting files) is still possible for
users when they log in with their web browser.

When an account is locked, administrators can unlock the account using
the `occ ransomguard:unlock` command. Administrators can also manually
lock user accounts, using the `occ ransomguard:lock` command.

When an account is locked, it will still be fully usable from the
ownCloud web UI. However, ownCloud clients (as well as other WebDAV
clients) will see the account as set to read-only mode.

Users will see a yellow notification banner in the ownCloud web UI
directing them to ``Personal Settings -> Security'' (``__Ransomware
detected: Your account is locked (read-only) for client access to
protect your data. Click here to unlock.__''), where additional
information is displayed and users can unlock their account when
ransomware issues are resolved locally.

Locking is enabled by default. If this is not desired, an administrator
can disable it in the ``Admin -> Security'' panel.

[[protection-data-retention-and-rollback]]
Protection: Data Retention and Rollback
---------------------------------------

While Ransomware Prevention mitigates risks of a range of ransomware
attacks, it is not a future-proof solution, because ransomware is
becoming ever-more sophisticated. There are known attacks that change
file extensions randomly or keep them unchanged which makes them harder
to detect.

Ultimately there is a consensus that only one solution can provide
future-proof protection from ransomware attacks: retaining data and
providing the means to roll back to a particular point in time.

ownCloud Ransomware Protection will, therefore, record all changes on an
ownCloud Server and allow administrators to rollback user data to a
particular point in time, making use of ownCloud’s integrated Versioning
and Trash bin features.

Doing so allows all user data that is synchronized with the server to be
rolled back to its state before the attack occurred. A combination of
Ransomware prevention and protection reduces risks to a minimum
acceptable level.

Other Elements of Ransomware Protection
---------------------------------------

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Command (if applicable) |Description
|Ransomware Prevention (Blocker) | |First line of defense against
ransomware attacks.

| | |Ransomware Protection uses a file name pattern blacklist

| | |to prevent uploading files that have file extensions

| | |associated with ransomware (e.g. ``.crypt'') thereby

| | |preserving the original files on the ownCloud Server.

|Ransomguard Scanner |`occ ransomguard:scan <timestamp> <user>` |A
command to scan the ownCloud database for

| | |changes in order to discover anomalies in a

| | |user’s account and their origin. It enables an

| | |administrator to determine the point in time

| | |where undesired actions happened as a

| | |prerequisite for restoration.

|Ransomguard Restorer |`occ ransomguard:restore <timestamp> <user>` |A
command for administrators to revert all

| | |operations in a user account that occurred after

| | |a certain point in time.

|Ransomguard Lock |`occ ransomguard:lock <user>` |Set a user account as
read-only for ownCloud and other

| | |WebDAV clients. This prevents any further changes to

| | |the account.

|Ransomguard Unlock |`occ ransomguard:unlock <user>` |Unlock a user
account which was set to read-only.

`<timestamp>` must be in the Linux timestamp format.

[[requirements]]
Requirements
------------

[[mandatory]]
Mandatory
~~~~~~~~~

1.  *File Firewall rule (previous approach for ransomware protection).*
If you have configured the File Firewall rule which was provided as a
preliminary protection mechanism, please remove it. The functionality
(Blocking) is covered by Ransomware Protection in an improved way.
2.  *Ransomware Protection.* Ransomware protection needs to be in
operation before an attack occurs, as it needs to record file operations
to be able to revert them, in case of an attack.
3.  *ownCloud Versions App.* Required to restore older file versions.
The capabilities of Ransomware Protection depend on its configuration
regarding version retention.
4.  *ownCloud Trash Bin App.* Required to restore deleted files. The
capabilities of Ransomware Protection depend on its configuration
regarding trash bin retention.

[[optional]]
Optional
~~~~~~~~

1.  *Activity app.* For viewing activity logs.

[[limitations]]
Limitations
-----------

* Ransomware Protection works with master-key based storage encryption.
With credential-based storage encryption, only Ransomware Prevention
(Blocking) works.
* Rollback is not based on snapshots:
** The
https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin\_manual/configuration/server/config\_sample\_php\_parameters.html?highlight=trash%20bin#deleted-items-trash-bin[trash
bin retention policy] may delete files, making them unrecoverable. To
avoid this, set `trashbin\_retention\_obligation` to `disabled`, or
choose a conservative policy for trash bin retention. However, please be
aware that this may increase storage requirements.
** Trash bin items may be deleted by the user making them unrecoverable
by Ransomware Protection => Users need to know this.
** Versions have
https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin\_manual/configuration/server/config\_sample\_php\_parameters.html?highlight=trash%20bin#file-versions[a
built-in ``thin-out'' policy] which makes it possible that required file
versions are unrecoverable by Ransomware Protection. To help avoid this,
set `versions\_retention\_obligation` to `disabled` or choose a
conservative policy for version retention. Please be aware that this
might increase your storage needs.
+
* A specific version of a file that is needed for rollback might have
been manually restored, making this version potentially unrecoverable by
Ransomware Protection. Currently, after restoration the restored version
is not a version anymore, e.g., the version is not present in
versioning.
* Recovery capabilities in received shared folders are currently
limited. Changed file contents and deletions can be restored but MOVE
operations can’t. The case when a ransomware attack renames files in a
received shared folder is therefore not yet covered.
* Contents in secondary storages, such as _Windows network drives_,
_Dropbox_, and _Google Drive_, are unrecoverable by Ransomware
Protection, because they do not have versioning or trash bin enabled in
ownCloud.
* Rolling files forward is not _currently_ supported or tested.
Therefore it is vital to:
** Carefully decide the point in time to rollback to.
** To have proper backups to be able to conduct the rollback again, if
necessary.
