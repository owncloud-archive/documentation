Installing & Upgrading ownCloud Enterprise Edition
==================================================

The recommended method for installing and maintaining your ownCloud
Enterprise edition is with your Linux package manager. Configure your
package manager to use the ownCloud Enterprise repository, import the
signing key, and then install and update ownCloud packages like any
other software package.

Please refer to the `README - ownCloud Package Installation.txt`
document in your account at
https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud/[Customer.owncloud.com] account
for instructions on setting up your Linux package manager.

After you have completed your initial installation of ownCloud as
detailed in the README, follow the instructions in
../../installation/installation_wizard to finish setting up ownCloud.

To upgrade your Enterprise server, refer to ../../maintenance/upgrade.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Youâ€™ll need to install a license key to use ownCloud Enterprise Edition.
There are two types of license keys: one is a free 30-day trial key. The
other is a full license key for Enterprise customers.

You can https://owncloud.com/download/[download and try ownCloud
Enterprise for 30 days for free], which auto-generates a free 30-day
key. When this key expires your ownCloud installation is not removed, so
when you become an Enterprise customer you can enter your new key to
regain access. See https://owncloud.com/how-to-buy-owncloud/[How to Buy
ownCloud] for sales and contact information.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you get your Enterprise license key, it needs to be copied to your
ownCloud configuration file, `config/config.php` file like this example:

[source,php]
....
'license-key' => 'test-20150101-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-YYYYYY',
....

Each running instance of ownCloud requires a license key. Keys will work
across upgrades without issue, so new keys will not be required when you
upgrade your ownCloud Enterprise to a new version.
