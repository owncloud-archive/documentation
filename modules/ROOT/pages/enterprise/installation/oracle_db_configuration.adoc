Oracle Database Setup
=====================

This document will cover the setup and preparation of the ownCloud
server to support the use of Oracle as a backend database.

[[outline-of-steps]]
Outline of Steps
----------------

This document will cover the following steps:

* Setup of the ownCloud user in Oracle: This involves setting up a user
space in Oracle for setting up the ownCloud database.
* Installing the Oracle Instant Client on the Web server (facilitating
the connection to the Oracle Database).
* Compiling and installing the Oracle PHP Plugin oci8 module
* Pointing ownCloud at the Oracle database in the initial setup process

The document assumes that you already have your Oracle instance running,
and have provisioned the needed resources. It also assumes that you have
installed ownCloud with all of the prerequisites.

Configuring Oracle
------------------

[[setting-up-the-user-space-for-owncloud]]
Setting up the User Space for ownCloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Step one, if it has not already been completed by your
DBA (DataBase Administrator), provision a user space on the Oracle
instance for ownCloud. This can be done by logging in as a DBA and
running the script below:

[source,sql]
....
CREATE USER owncloud IDENTIFIED BY password;
ALTER USER owncloud DEFAULT TABLESPACE users TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp QUOTA unlimited ON users;
GRANT create session, create table, create procedure, create sequence, create trigger, create view, create synonym, alter session TO owncloud;
....

Substitute an actual password for `password`. Items like _TableSpace_,
_Quota_ etc., will be determined by your DBA (database administrator).

[[add-oci8-client-packages]]
Add OCI8 Client Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation of the OCI8 client is dependent on your distribution. Given
that, please use the relevant section below to find the relevant
instructions to install the client.

[[ubuntu]]
Ubuntu
^^^^^^

If you’re using Ubuntu, we recommend that you use
this very thorough guide from the Ubuntu Community Wiki to install the
OCI8 extension.

NOTE: This _should_ work for other Debian-based distributions, however your mileage may vary.

[[redhat-centos-fedora]]
RedHat / Centos / Fedora
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the OCI8 extension on a RedHat-based distribution, you first
need to download two Oracle Instant Client packages:

* Instant Client Package - Basic
(`oracle-instantclient12.2-basic-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm`)
* Instant Client Package - SDK
(`oracle-instantclient12.2-devel-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm`)

Then, to install them, use the following commands:

[source,console]
----
rpm --install oracle-instantclient12.2-basic-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm \
  oracle-instantclient12.2-devel-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
----

[[install-the-oci8-php-extension]]
Install the OCI8 PHP Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the Oracle packages installed you’re now ready to install PHP’s
OCI8 extension.

NOTE: Provide: `instantclient,/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib` when requested, or let it auto-detect the location (if possible).

[source,console]
----
pecl install oci8
----

With the extension installed, you now need to configure it, by creating
a configuration file for it. You can do so using the command below,
substituting `FILE_PATH` with one from the list below the command.

[source,console]
----
cat << EOF > FILE_PATH
; Oracle Instant Client Shared Object extension
extension=oci8.so
EOF
----

[[configuration-file-paths]]
Configuration File Paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[debian-ubuntu]]
Debian & Ubuntu
+++++++++++++++

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=============================================
|PHP Version |Filename
|5.6 |`/etc/php/5.6/apache2/conf.d/20-oci.ini`
|7.0 |`/etc/php/7.0/apache2/conf.d/20-oci.ini`
|7.1 |`/etc/php/7.1/apache2/conf.d/20-oci.ini`
|=============================================

[[redhat-centos-fedora-1]]
RedHat, Centos, & Fedora
++++++++++++++++++++++++

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=============================================
|PHP Version |Filename
|5.6 |`/etc/opt/rh/rh-php56/php.d/20-oci8.ini`
|7.0 |`/etc/opt/rh/rh-php70/php.d/20-oci8.ini`
|=============================================

[[validating-the-extension]]
Validating the Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With all that done, confirm that it’s been installed and available in
your PHP distribution, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
php -m | grep -i oci8
----

When the process has completed, assuming that you don’t encounter any
errors, restart Apache and the extension is ready to use.

[[configure-owncloud]]
Configure ownCloud
------------------

The next step is to configure the ownCloud instance to point to the
Oracle Database, again this document assumes that ownCloud has
previously been installed.

[[configuration-wizard]]
Configuration Wizard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/oracle-1.png[image,width=554,height=711]

[[database-user]]
Database user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the user space created in step 2.1. In our Example this would be
owncloud.

[[database-password]]
Database password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Again this is defined in the script from section 2.1 above, or
pre-configured and provided to you by your DBA.

[[database-name]]
Database Name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Represents the database or the service that has been pre-configured on
the TSN Listener on the Database Server. This should also be provided by
the DBA. In this example, the default setup in the Oracle install was
orcl (there is a TSN Listener entry for orcl on our database server).

This is not like setting up with MySQL or SQL Server, where a database
based on the name you give is created. The oci8 code will call this
specific service and it must be active on the TSN Listener on your
Oracle Database server.

[[database-table-space]]
Database Table Space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provided by the DBA. In this example the users table space (as is seen
in the user creation script above), was used.

[[configuration-file]]
Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming all of the steps have been followed to completion, the first
run wizard should complete successfully, and an operating instance of
ownCloud should appear.

The configuration file should look something like this:
