Upgrading ownCloud with the Updater App
=======================================

The Updater app automates many of the steps of upgrading an ownCloud
installation. It is useful for installations that do not have root
access, such as shared hosting, for installations with a smaller number
of users and data, and it automates xref:installation/source_installation.adoc[manual installations].

IMPORTANT: When upgrading from oC 9.0 to 9.1 with existing Calendars or Adressbooks please have a look at the xref:release_notes.adoc[release notes] of oC 9.0 for important info about this migration.

[CAUTION]
====
* The Updater app is not enabled and not supported in ownCloud Enterprise edition.
* The Updater app is not included in the https://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/stable/owncloud/[Linux
packages on our Open Build Service], but only in the https://owncloud.org/install/#instructions-server[tar and zip archives].
* When you install ownCloud from packages you should keep it updated with your package manager.
====

*Downgrading* is not supported and risks corrupting your data! If you
want to revert to an older ownCloud version, install it from scratch and
then restore your data from backup. Before doing this, file a support
ticket (if you have paid support) or ask for help in the ownCloud forums
to see if your issue can be resolved without downgrading.

You should maintain regular backups (see backup), and make a backup
before every update. The Updater app does not backup your database or
data directory.

The Updater app performs these operations:

* Creates an `updater_backup` directory under your ownCloud data
directory
* Downloads and extracts updated package content into the
`updater_backup/packageVersion` directory
* Makes a copy of your current ownCloud instance, except for your data
directory, to `updater_backup/currentVersion-randomstring`
* Moves all directories except `data` and `config` from the current
instance to `updater_backup/tmp`
* Moves all directories from `updater_backup/packageVersion` to the
current version
* Copies your old `config.php` to the new `config/` directory

[TIP] 
====
Backups created by the updater app can use up significant disc space, if kept across multiple updates. 
We recommend that you save storage space by only keeping the ones that are crucial to your instance and removing any others.
====

Using the Updater app to update your ownCloud installation is just a few
steps:

1.  You should see a notification at the top of any ownCloud page when
there is a new update available.
2.  Even though the Updater app backs up important directories, you
should always have your own current backups (See xref:maintenance/backup.adoc[Backing up ownCloud] for details.)
3.  Verify that the HTTP user on your system can write to your whole
ownCloud directory; see the xref:setting-permissions-for-updating[Setting Permissions for Updating] section
below.
4.  Navigate to your Admin page and click the *Update Center* button
under Updater. This takes you to the Updater control panel.
5.  Click Update, and carefully read the messages. If there are any
problems it will tell you. The most common issue is directory
permissions; your HTTP user needs write permissions to your whole
ownCloud directory. (See xref:installation/source_installation.adoc#set-strong-directory-permissions[Set Strong Directory Permissions].) Another common issue is
SELinux rules (see xref:installation/selinux_configuration.adoc[SELinux Configuration].) Otherwise you will see
messages about checking your installation and making backups.
6.  Click Proceed, and then it performs the remaining steps, which takes
a few minutes.
7.  If your directory permissions are correct, a backup was made, and
downloading the new ownCloud archive succeeded you will see the
following screen. Click the Start Update button to complete your update:

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/maintenance/upgrade-2.png[image]

NOTE: If you have a large ownCloud installation and have shell access, you should use the `occ upgrade` command, running it as your HTTP user, instead of clicking the Start Update button, in order to avoid PHP timeouts.

This example is for Ubuntu Linux:

....
$ sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade
....

The optional parameter to skip migration tests during this step was
removed in oC 9.2. See xref:maintenance/updated.adoc[Testing a Migration] for more information.

1.  It runs for a few minutes, and when it is finished displays a
success message, which disappears after a short time.

Refresh your Admin page to verify your new version number. In the
Updater section of your Admin page you can see the current status and
backups. These are backups of your old and new ownCloud installations,
and do not contain your data files. If your update works and there are
no problems you can delete the backups from this screen.

If the update fails, then you must xref:maintenance/manual_upgrade.adoc[update manually].

[[setting-permissions-for-updating]]
Setting Permissions for Updating
--------------------------------

For hardened security, we highly recommend setting the permissions on
your ownCloud directory as strictly as possible, immediately after the
initial installation. However, these strict permissions will prevent the
Updater app from working, as it needs your whole ownCloud directory to
be owned by the HTTP user.

So to set the appropriate permissions for updating, run the code below.
Replace the `ocpath` variable with the path to your ownCloud directory,
and replace the `htuser` and `htgroup` variables with your HTTP user and
group.

....
#!/bin/bash
# Sets permissions of the owncloud instance for updating

ocpath='/var/www/owncloud'
htuser='www-data'
htgroup='www-data'

chown -R ${htuser}:${htgroup} ${ocpath}
....

You can find your HTTP user in your HTTP server configuration files. Or
you can use xref:issues/general_troubleshooting.adoc#php-version-and-information[PHP Version and Information]. 
Look for the `User/Group` line.

* The HTTP user and group in Debian/Ubuntu is `www-data`.
* The HTTP user and group in Fedora/CentOS is `apache`.
* The HTTP user and group in Arch Linux is `http`.
* The HTTP user in openSUSE is `wwwrun`, and the HTTP group is `www`.

After the update is completed, re-apply xref:installation/source_installation.adoc#set-strong-directory-permissions[the strong directory permissions] immediately.

[[command-line-options]]
Command Line Options
--------------------

The Updater app includes command-line options to automate updates, to
create checkpoints and to roll back to older checkpoints. You must run
it as your HTTP user. This example on Ubuntu Linux displays command
options:

....
sudo -u www-data php updater/application.php list
....

See usage for commands, like this example for the `upgrade:checkpoint`
command:

....
sudo -u www-data php updater/application.php upgrade:checkpoint -h
....

You can display a help summary:

....
sudo -u www-data php updater/application.php --help
....

When you run it without options it runs a system check:

....
sudo -u www-data php owncloud/updater/application.php
ownCloud updater 1.0 - CLI based ownCloud server upgrades
Checking system health.
- file permissions are ok.
Current version is 9.0.0.12
No updates found online.
Done
....

Create a checkpoint:

....
sudo -u www-data php updater/application.php upgrade:checkpoint  --create 
Created checkpoint 9.0.0.12-56d5e4e004964
....

List checkpoints:

....
sudo -u www-data php updater/application.php upgrade:checkpoint --list
....

Restore an earlier checkpoint:

....
sudo -u www-data php owncloud/updater/application.php upgrade:checkpoint 
 --restore=9.0.0.12-56d5e4e004964
....

Add a line like this to your crontab to automatically create daily
checkpoints:

....
2 15 * * * sudo -u www-data php /path/to/owncloud/updater/application.php 
upgrade:checkpoint --create > /dev/null 2>&1
....

[[updater.secret-value-in-config.php]]
updater.secret value in config.php
----------------------------------

When running the updater, you will be prompted to add a hashed secret
into your config.php file. On the updater web interface, you then need
to enter the unhashed secret into the web form.

In case you forgot your password/secret, you can re-create it by
changing config.php. You can run this on your shell:

....
php -r 'echo password_hash("Enter a random password here", PASSWORD_DEFAULT)."\n";'
....

Please replace `Enter a random password here` with your own. 
Then add this into your config.php:

....
'updater.secret' => 'The value you got from the above hash command',
....
