Upgrade ownCloud From Packages
==============================

[[upgrade-quickstart]]
Upgrade Quickstart
------------------

The best method for keeping ownCloud current on Linux servers is by
configuring your system to use ownCloud’s
https://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/stable/owncloud/[Open
Build Service] repository. Then stay current by using your Linux package
manager to install fresh ownCloud packages. After installing upgraded
packages you must run a few more steps to complete the upgrade. These
are the basic steps to upgrading ownCloud:

Make sure that you don’t skip a major release when upgrading via
repositories. For example you can’t upgrade from 8.1.x to 9.0.x directly
as you would skip the 8.2.x major release. See
skipped_release_upgrade_label for more information.

* Disable <../installation/apps_management_installation> all third-party
apps.
* Make a fresh backup <backup>.
* Upgrade your ownCloud packages.
* Run occ upgrade <command_line_upgrade_label> (The optional parameter
to skip migration tests was removed from oC 9.2. See
migration_test_label for background information).
* Apply strong permissions <strong_perms_label> to your ownCloud
directories.
* Take your ownCloud server out of
maintenance mode <maintenance_commands_label>.
* Re-enable third-party apps.

When upgrading from oC 9.0 to 9.1 with existing Calendars or
Addressbooks please have a look at the
9.0 release notes<9.0_release_notes_label> for important information
about the needed migration steps during that upgrade.

Upgrade Tips
------------

Upgrading ownCloud from our
https://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/stable/owncloud/[Open
Build Service] repository is just like any normal Linux upgrade. For
example, on Debian or Ubuntu Linux this is the standard system upgrade
command:

....
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
....

Or you can upgrade just ownCloud with this command:

....
apt-get update && apt-get install owncloud-files
....

On Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Linux use `yum` to see all available
updates:

....
yum check-update
....

You can apply all available updates with this command:

....
yum update
....

Or update only ownCloud:

....
yum update owncloud-files
....

Your Linux package manager only downloads the current ownCloud packages.
Then your ownCloud server is immediately put into maintenance mode. You
may not see this until you refresh your ownCloud page.

Then use `occ` to complete the upgrade. You must run `occ` as your HTTP
user. This example is for Debian/Ubuntu:

....
sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade
....

This example is for CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:

....
sudo -u apache php occ upgrade
....

The optional parameter to skip migration tests during this step was
removed in oC 9.2. See migration_test_label for background information.

See ../configuration/server/occ_command to learn more.

Setting Strong Directory Permissions
------------------------------------

After upgrading, verify that your ownCloud directory permissions are set
according to strong_perms_label.

[[upgrading-across-skipped-releases]]
Upgrading Across Skipped Releases
---------------------------------

It is best to update your ownCloud installation with every new point
release (e.g. 8.1.10), and to never skip any major release (e.g. don’t
skip 8.2.x between 8.1.x and 9.0.x). If you have skipped any major
release you can bring your ownCloud current with these steps:

1.  Add the repository of your current version (e.g. 8.1.x)
2.  Upgrade your current version to the latest point release (e.g.
8.1.10) via your package manager
3.  Run the `occ upgrade` routine (see Upgrade Quickstart above)
4.  Add the repository of the next major release (e.g. 8.2.x)
5.  Upgrade your current version to the next major release (e.g. 8.2.8)
via your package manager
6.  Run the `occ upgrade` routine (see Upgrade Quickstart above)
7.  Repeat from step 4 until you reach the last available major release
(e.g. 9.1.x)

You’ll find repositories of previous ownCloud major releases in the
https://owncloud.org/changelog/[ownCloud Server Changelog].
