How To Manually Move a Data Directory
=====================================

If you need to move your ownCloud data directory from its current
location to somewhere else, here is a manual process that you can take
to make it happen.

This example assumes that:

* The current folder is: /var/www/owncloud/data
* The new folder is: /mnt/owncloud
* You’re using Apache as your webserver

1.  Stop Apache
2.  Use rsync to sync the files from the current folder to the new one
3.  Create a symbolic link from the new directory to the old one
4.  Double-check
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/installation_wizard.html#strong-perms-label[the
directory permissions] on the new directory
5.  Restart Apache

To save time, here’s the commands which you can copy and use:

....
apachectl -k stop 
rsync -avz /var/www/owncloud/data /mnt/owncloud
ln -s /mnt/owncloud /var/www/owncloud/data
apachectl -k graceful 
....

If you’re on CentOS/Fedora, try `systemctl restart httpd`. If you’re on
Debian/Ubuntu try `sudo systemctl restart apache2` To learn more about
the systemctl command, please refer to

Fix Hardcoded Database Path Variables
-------------------------------------

[[update-the-oc_storages-table]]
Update the oc_storages table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to manually change the location of the data folder in the
database, run the SQL below:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE oc_storages SET id='local::/mnt/owncloud' 
  WHERE id='local::/var/www/owncloud/data/';
----

[[update-the-oc_accounts-table]]
Update the oc_accounts table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You next need to update the `home` column in the `oc_accounts` table.
This column contains the absolute path for user folders, e.g.,
`/mnt/data/files/admin`. Assuming that the new home directory is:
`/mnt/data/files/super-admin`, and that the user’s id is 1, you could
change it using the following SQL statement:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE oc_accounts SET home='/mnt/data/files/super-admin' 
  WHERE id=1;
----

Please don’t copy and paste this example verbatim — nor any of the
others. It, and the others, are provided only as guides to what you
should or could do.

[[update-the-oc_jobs-table]]
Update the oc_jobs table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next area to check is the oc_jobs table. The logrotate process may
have hard-coded a non-standard (or old) value for the data path. To
check it, run the SQL below and see if any results are returned:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM oc_jobs 
  WHERE class = 'OC\Log\Rotate';
----

If any are, run the SQL below to update them, changing the value as
appropriate.

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE oc_jobs SET argument = '/your/new/data/path' 
  WHERE id = <id of the incorrect record>;
----

[[fix-application-settings]]
Fix Application Settings
------------------------

One thing worth noting is that individual apps may reference the data
directory separate from the core system configuration. If so, then you
will need to find which applications do this, and change them as needed.

For example, if you listed the application configuration by running occ
config:list, then you might see output similar to that below:

[source,json]
----
{
    "apps": {
        "fictitious": {
            "enabled": "yes",
            "installed_version": "2.3.2",
            "types": "filesystem",
            "datadir": "var/www/owncloud/data"
        }
    }
}
----

Here, the ``fictitious'' application references the data directory as
being set to var/www/owncloud/data. So you would have to change the
value by using the config:app:set option. Here’s an example of how you
would update the setting:

[source,console]
----
occ config:app:set --value /mnt/owncloud fictitious datadir
----
