The Installation Wizard
=======================

If you are planning to use the installation wizard, we *strongly*
encourage you to protect it, through some form of
https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/PasswordBasicAuth[password
authentication], or
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/access.html[access control]. If
the installer is left unprotected when exposed to the public internet,
there is the possibility that a malicious actor could finish the
installation and block you out — or worse. So please ensure that only
you — or someone from your organization — can access the web installer.

[[quick-start]]
Quick Start
-----------

When the ownCloud prerequisites are fulfilled and all ownCloud files are
installed, the last step to completing the installation is running the
Installation Wizard. This involves just three steps:

1.  Point your web browser to `http://localhost/owncloud`
2.  Enter your desired administrator’s username and password.
3.  Click ``Finish Setup''.

You’re now finished and can start using your new ownCloud server. Of
course, there is much more that you _can_ do to set up your ownCloud
server for best performance and security. In the following sections we
will cover important installation and post-installation steps. Note that
you must follow the instructions in
Setting Strong Permissions <strong_perms_label> in order to use the
occ Command <../configuration/server/occ_command>.

In-Depth Guide

This section provides a more detailed guide to the installation wizard.
Specifically, it is broken down into three steps:

1.  Data Directory Location <data_directory_location_label>
2.  Database Choices <database_choice_label>
3.  Post-Installation Steps <post_installation_steps_label>

[[data-directory-location]]
Data Directory Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click ``Storage and Database'' to expose additional installation
configuration options for your ownCloud data directory and database.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/install-wizard-a1.png[image]

You should locate your ownCloud data directory outside of your Web root
if you are using an HTTP server other than Apache, or you may wish to
store your ownCloud data in a different location for other reasons (e.g.
on a storage server).

Please know that ownCloud’s data directory *must be exclusive to
ownCloud* and not be modified manually by any other process or user.

It is best to configure your data directory location at installation, as
it is difficult to move after installation. You may put it anywhere; in
this example is it located in `/var/oc_data`. This directory must
already exist, and must be owned by your HTTP user (see
strong_perms_label).

[[database-choices]]
Database Choices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When installing ownCloud Server & ownCloud Enterprise editions the
administrator may choose one of 4 supported database products. These
are:

* SQLite
* MYSQL/MariaDB
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle 11g (Enterprise-edition only)

[[sqlite]]
SQLite
^^^^^^

SQLite is the default database for ownCloud Server — but is not
supported by the ownCloud Enterprise edition.

SQLite is only good for testing and lightweight single user setups. It
has no client synchronization support, so other devices will not be able
to synchronize with the data stored in an ownCloud SQLite database.

SQLite will be installed by the ownCloud package and all the necessary
dependencies will be satisfied. If you used the package manager to
install ownCloud, you may ``Finish Setup'' with no additional steps to
configure ownCloud using the SQLite database for limited use.

[[mysqlmariadb]]
MYSQL/MariaDB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MariaDB is the ownCloud recommended database. It may be used with either
ownCloud Server or ownCloud Enterprise editions. To install the
recommended MySQL/MariaDB database, use the following command:

....
sudo apt-get install mariadb-server
....

If you have an administrator login that has permissions to create and
modify databases, you may choose ``Storage & Database''. Then, enter
your database administrator username and password, and the name you want
for your ownCloud database. Alternatively, you can use these steps to
create a temporary database administrator account.

....
sudo mysql --user=root mysql
CREATE USER 'dbadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Apassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dbadmin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
....

For more detailed information, see MySQL/MariaDB <system_requirements>.

[[postgresql]]
PostgreSQL
^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL] is also supported by ownCloud. To
install it, use the following command (or that of your preferred package
manager):

....
sudo apt-get install postgresql
....

In order to allow ownCloud access to the database, create a known
password for the default user, `postgres`, which was added when the
database was installed.

....
sudo -i -u postgres psql
postgres=# \password
Enter new password: 
Enter it again:
postgres=# \q
exit
....

[[oracle-11g]]
Oracle 11g
^^^^^^^^^^

Oracle 11g is only supported for the ownCloud Enterprise edition.

[[database-setup-by-owncloud]]
Database Setup By ownCloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your database and PHP connectors must be installed before you run the
Installation Wizard by clicking the ``Finish setup'' button. After you
enter your temporary or root administrator login for your database, the
installer creates a special database user with privileges limited to the
ownCloud database.

Following this, ownCloud needs only this special ownCloud database user
and drops the temporary or root database login. This new user is named
from your ownCloud admin user, with an `oc_` prefix, and given a random
password. The ownCloud database user and password are written into
`config.php`:

For MySQL/MariaDB:

....
'dbuser' => 'oc_dbadmin',
'dbpassword' => 'pX65Ty5DrHQkYPE5HRsDvyFHlZZHcm',
....

For PostgreSQL:

....
'dbuser' => 'oc_postgres',
'dbpassword' => 'pX65Ty5DrHQkYPE5HRsDvyFHlZZHcm',
....

Click Finish Setup, and you’re ready to start using your new ownCloud
server.

[[post-installation-steps]]
Post-Installation Steps
-----------------------

Now we will look at some important post-installation steps. For hardened
security we recommend setting the permissions on your ownCloud
directories as strictly as possible, and for proper server operations.
This should be done immediately after the initial installation and
before running the setup.

Your HTTP user must own the `config/`, `data/`, `apps/` respectively the
`apps-external/` directories so that you can configure ownCloud, create,
modify and delete your data files, and install apps via the ownCloud Web
interface.

You can find your HTTP user in your HTTP server configuration files, or
you can use label-phpinfo (Look for the *User/Group* line).

* The HTTP user and group in Debian/Ubuntu is `www-data`.
* The HTTP user and group in Fedora/CentOS is `apache`.
* The HTTP user and group in Arch Linux is `http`.
* The HTTP user in openSUSE is `wwwrun`, and the HTTP group is `www`.

When using an NFS mount for the data directory, do not change its
ownership from the default. The simple act of mounting the drive will
set proper permissions for ownCloud to write to the directory. Changing
ownership as above could result in some issues if the NFS mount is lost.

The easy way to set the correct permissions is to copy and run the
script, below. The script sets proper permissions and ownership
including the handling of necessary directories. The script also
prepares for an `apps-external` directory, for details see
`config.sample.php`:

* Replace the `ocpath` variable with the path to your ownCloud
directory.
* Replace the `ocdata` variable with the path to your ownCloud data
directory.
* Replace the `apps_external` variable with the path to your ownCloud
apps-external directory.

In case use want to use links for the data and apps-external directory:

* Replace the `linkdata` variable with the path to your ownCloud linked
data directory.
* Replace the `linkapps-external` variable with the path to your
ownCloud linked apps-external directory.

Set the correct HTTP user and group according your needs:

* Replace the `htuser` and `htgroup` variables with your HTTP user and
group.

In case of upgrading using tar:

* Replace the `oldocpath` variable with the path to your old ownCloud
directory.

If you have customized your ownCloud installation and your file paths
are different than the standard installation, modify this script
accordingly.

This summary lists the recommended modes and ownership for your ownCloud
directories and files:

* All files should be read-write for the file owner, read-only for the
group owner, and zero for the world
* All directories should be executable (because directories always need
the executable bit set), read-write for the directory owner, and
read-only for the group owner
* The apps/ directory should be owned by `[HTTP user]:[HTTP group]`
* The apps-external/ directory should be owned by
`[HTTP user]:[HTTP group]`
* The config/ directory should be owned by `[HTTP user]:[HTTP group]`
* The data/ directory should be owned by `[HTTP user]:[HTTP group]`
* The updater/ directory should be owned by `[HTTP user]:[HTTP group]`
* The [ocpath]/.htaccess file should be owned by `root:[HTTP group]`
* The data/.htaccess file should be owned by `root:[HTTP group]`
* Both .htaccess files are read-write file owner, read-only group and
world

These strong permissions prevent upgrading your ownCloud server; see
set_updating_permissions_label for a script to quickly change
permissions to allow upgrading.
