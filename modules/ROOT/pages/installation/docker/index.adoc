Installing with Docker
======================

ownCloud can be installed using Docker, using
https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/server/[the official ownCloud Docker
image]. This official image is designed to work with a data volume in
the host filesystem and with separate _MariaDB_ and _Redis_ containers.
The configuration:

* exposes ports 80 and 443, allowing for HTTP and HTTPS connections.
* mounts the data and MySQL data directories on the host for persistent
storage.

Installation on a Local Machine
-------------------------------

To use it, first create a new project directory and download
`docker-compose.yml` from
https://github.com/owncloud-docker/server.git[the ownCloud Docker GitHub
repository] into that new directory. Next, create a .env configuration
file, which contains the required configuration settings. Only a few
settings are required, these are:

[cols=3,options=header]
|===
|Setting Name 
|Description 
|Example

|`OWNCLOUD_VERSION` 
|The ownCloud version 
|`latest`

|`OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN` 
|The ownCloud domain 
|`localhost`

|`ADMIN_USERNAME` 
|The admin username 
|`admin`

|`ADMIN_PASSWORD` 
|The admin user’s password 
|`admin`

|`HTTP_PORT` 
|The HTTP port to bind to 
|`80`

|`HTTPS_PORT` 
|The HTTP port to bind to 
|`443`
|===

Then, you can start the container, using your preferred Docker
command-line tool. The example below shows how to use
https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose].

You can find instructions for using plain docker
https://github.com/owncloud-docker/server#launch-with-plain-docker[in
the GitHub repository].

[source,console]
----
# Create a new project directory
mkdir owncloud-docker-server

cd owncloud-docker-server

# Copy docker-compose.yml from the GitHub repository
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owncloud-docker/server/master/docker-compose.yml

# Create the environment configuration file
cat << EOF > .env
OWNCLOUD_VERSION=10.0
OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN=localhost
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
HTTP_PORT=80
HTTPS_PORT=443
EOF

# Build and start the container
docker-compose up -d
----

When the process completes, then check that all the containers have
successfully started, by running `docker-compose ps`. If they are all
working correctly, you should expect to see output similar to that
below:

[source,console]
....
Name                Command                       State             Ports
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
server_db_1         /usr/bin/entrypoint/bin/s …   Up                3306/tcp 
server_owncloud_1   /usr/local/bin/entrypoint …   Up                0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp 
server_redis_1      /bin/s6-svscan /etc/s6        Up                6379/tcp
....

In it, you can see that the database, ownCloud, and Redis containers are
running, and that ownCloud is accessible via ports 443 and 8080 on the
host machine.

Just because all the containers are running, it takes a few minutes for
ownCloud to be fully functional. If you run
`docker-compose logs --follow owncloud` and see a significant amount of
information logging to the console, then please wait until it slows down
to attempt to access the web UI.

[[logging-in]]
Logging In
~~~~~~~~~~

To log in to the ownCloud UI, open `https://localhost` in your browser
of choice, where you see the standard ownCloud login screen, as in the
image below.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/docker/owncloud-ui-login.png[The ownCloud UI via Docker]

The username and password are the admin username and password which you
stored in `.env` earlier.

The first time that you access the login page via HTTPS, a browser
warning appears, as the SSL certificate in the Docker setup is
self-signed. However, the self-signed certificate can be overwritten
with a valid cert, within the host volume.

[[stopping-the-containers]]
Stopping the Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming you used docker-compose, as in the previous example, to stop
the containers use `docker-compose stop`. Alternatively, use
`docker-compose down` to stop and remove containers, along with the
related networks, images, and volumes.

[[upgrading-owncloud-on-docker]]
Upgrading ownCloud on Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a new version of ownCloud gets released, you should update your
instance. To do so, follow these simple steps.

First, go to your docker directory where your `.yaml` or `.env` file
exists. Second, put ownCloud into maintenance mode; you can do so using
the following command:

[source,console]
....
docker-compose exec server occ maintenance:mode --on
....

Third, create a backup in case something goes wrong during the upgrade
process, using the following command:

[source,console]
....
docker-compose exec db backup
....

This assumes that you are using
https://hub.docker.com/r/webhippie/mariadb/[the default database
container from Webhippie].

Fifth, shutdown the containers.

[source,console]
....
docker-compose down
....

Sixth, update the version number of ownCloud in your `.env` file or the
YAML file. You can use sed for it, as in the following example.

[source,console]
....
# Make sure that you adjust the example to match your installation.
sed -i 's/^OWNCLOUD_VERSION=.*$/OWNCLOUD_VERSION=<newVersion>/' /compose/*/.env
....

Seventh, view the file to ensure the changes has been implemented.

....
cat .env
....

Eighth, start your docker instance again.

....
docker-compose up -d
....

Now you should have the current ownCloud running with docker-compose.
