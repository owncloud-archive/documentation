NGINX Configuration
===================

This page covers example NGINX configurations to use with running an
ownCloud server. Note that NGINX is _not officially supported_, and this
page is _community-maintained_. Thank you, contributors!

* Depending on your setup, you need to insert the code examples into
your NGINX configuration file.
* Adjust *server_name*, *root*, *ssl_certificate*, *ssl_certificate_key*
ect. to suit your needs.
* Make sure your SSL certificates are readable by the server (see
http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSslModule[NGINX HTTP SSL Module
documentation]).
* `add_header` statements are only valid in the current `location` block
and are not derived or cascaded from or to a different `location` block.
All necessary `add_header` statements *must* be defined in each
`location` block needed.
* For better readability it is possible to move _common_ `add_header`
directives into a separate file and include that file wherever
necessary. However, each `add_header` directive must be written in a
single line to prevent connection problems with sync clients.
* The same is true for `map` directives which also can be collected into
a singe file and then be included.

Example Configurations
----------------------

Be careful about line breaks if you copy the examples, as long lines may
be broken for page formatting.

You can use ownCloud over plain HTTP. However, _we strongly encourage
you_ to use SSL/TLS to encrypt all of your server traffic *and* to
protect users’ logins, and their data while it is in transit. To use
plain HTTP:

1.  Remove the server block containing the redirect
2.  Change *listen 443 ssl http2* to *listen 80;*
3.  Remove all *link:[ssl]* entries.
4.  Remove *fastcgi_params HTTPS on;*

[[note-1]]
Note 1
~~~~~~

....
fastcgi_buffers 8 4K;
....

* Do not set the number of buffers to greater than 63. In our example,
it is set to 8.
* If you exceed this maximum, big file downloads may consume a lot of
system memory over time. This is especially problematic on low-memory
systems.

[[note-2]]
Note 2
~~~~~~

....
fastcgi_ignore_headers
X-Accel-Buffering
....

* From ownCloud version 10.0.4 on, a header will be sent to NGINX not to
use buffers to avoid problems with problematic `fastcgi_buffers` values.
See note above.
* If the values of `fastcgi_buffers` are properly set and no problems
are expected, you can use this directive to reenable buffering
*overriding* the sent header.
* In case you use an earlier version of ownCloud or can´t change the
buffers, or can´t remove a existing ignore header directive, you can
explicitly enable following directive in the location block
`fastcgi_buffering off;`

The directives `fastcgi_ignore_headers X-Accel-Buffering;` and
`fastcgi_buffering off;` can be used separately but not together.

[[owncloud-in-the-web-root-of-nginx]]
ownCloud in the web root of NGINX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following config should be used when ownCloud is placed in the web
root of your NGINX installation.

The configuration assumes that ownCloud is installed in `/var/www/owncloud` and is accessed via `http(s)://cloud.example.com`.

[[owncloud-in-a-subdirectory-of-nginx]]
ownCloud in a subdirectory of NGINX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following config should be used when ownCloud is placed under a
different context root of your NGINX installation such as /owncloud or
/cloud.

The configuration assumes that ownCloud is installed in `/var/www/owncloud` is accessed via `http(s)://example.com/owncloud` and that you have `'overwriteweb root' => '/owncloud',` set in your `config/config.php`.

[[troubleshooting]]
Troubleshooting
---------------

[[javascript-.js-or-css-.css-files-not-served-properly]]
JavaScript (.js) or CSS (.css) files not served properly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A standard issue with custom NGINX configurations is, that JavaScript
(.js) or CSS (.css) files are not served properly, leading to a 404
(File Not Found) error on those files and a broken web interface.

* This could be caused by an inproper sequence of `location` blocks.
+
The following sequence is correct:

[source,nginx]
....
  location ~ \.php(?:$|/) {
   ...
  }

  location ~ \.(?:css|js)$ {
   ...
  }
....

Other custom configurations like caching JavaScript (.js) or CSS (.css)
files via gzip could also cause such issues.

[[not-all-of-my-contacts-are-synchronized]]
Not all of my contacts are synchronized
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check for server timeouts! It turns out that CardDAV sync often fails
silently if the request runs into timeouts. With PHP-FPM you might see a
``CoreDAVHTTPStatusErrorDomain error 504'' which is an ``HTTP 504
Gateway timeout'' error. To solve this, first check the
`default_socket_timeout` setting in `/etc/php/7.0/fpm/php.ini` and
increase the above `fastcgi_read_timeout` accordingly. Depending on your
server’s performance a timeout of 180s should be sufficient to sync an
address book of ~1000 contacts.

[[windows-error-0x80070043-the-network-name-cannot-be-found.-while-adding-a-network-drive]]
=== Windows: Error 0x80070043 ``The network name cannot be found.'' while adding a network drive

The windows native WebDAV client might fail with the following error
message:

....
Error 0x80070043 "The network name cannot be found." while adding a network drive
....

A known workaround for this issue is to update your web server
configuration.

[verse]
--
Because NGINX does not allow nested http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html[if] directives, you need to use the http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_map_module.html[map] directive.
The position of the http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location[location] directive is important for success.
--

*1 Create a map directive outside your server block*

[source,nginx]
----
# Fixes Windows WebDav client error 0x80070043 "The network name cannot be found."
map "$http_user_agent:$request_method" $WinWebDav {
    default         0;
    "DavClnt:OPTIONS"   1;
}
----

*2 Inside your server block on top of your location directives*

[source,nginx]
----
location = / {
    if ($WinWebDav) { return 401; }
}

Log Optimisation
----------------

[[suppressing-htaccesstest.txt-and-.ocdata-log-messages]]
Suppressing `htaccesstest.txt` and `.ocdata` Log Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are seeing meaningless messages in your logfile, for example
https://central.owncloud.org/t/htaccesstest-txt-errors-in-logfiles/831[client
denied by server configuration: /var/www/data/htaccesstest.txt], or
access to `.ocdata`, add this section to your NGINX configuration to
suppress them:

[source,nginx]
----
location = /data/htaccesstest.txt {
    allow all;
    log_not_found off;
    access_log off;
}
----

[source,nginx]
----
location = /data/\.ocdata {
    access_log off;
}
----

[[prevent-access-log-entries-when-accessing-thumbnails]]
Prevent access log entries when accessing thumbnails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using eg. the Gallery App, any access to a thumbnail of a picture
will be logged. This can cause a massive log quanity making log reading
challenging. With this approach, you can prevent access logging for
those thumbnails.

*1 Create a map directive outside your server block like*

______________________________________________
(Adopt the path queried according your needs.)
______________________________________________

[source,nginx]
----
# do not access log to gallery thumbnails, flooding access logs only, error will be logged anyway
map $request_uri $loggable {
    default                              1;
    ~*\/apps\/gallery\/thumbnails        0;
}
----

*2 Inside your server block where you define your logs*

[source,nginx]
----
access_log /path-to-your-log-file combined if=$loggable;
----

If you want or need to log thumbnails access, you can easily add another
logfile which only logs this access. You can easily enable / disable
this kind of logging if you uncomment / comment the line starting with
`0` in the following `map` directive.

*Below the above map statement*

[source,nginx]
----
# invert the $loggable variable
map $loggable $invertloggable {
    default                         0;
    0                               1;
}
----

*Below the above access_log statement*

[source,nginx]
----
access_log /var/log/nginx/<your-log-file-inverted> combined if=$invertloggable;
----

[[performance-tuning]]
Performance Tuning
------------------

*1 HTTP/2*

To increase the performance of your NGINX installation, we recommend
using either the SPDY or HTTP_V2 modules, depending on your installed
NGINX version.

* nginx (<1.9.5)
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_spdy_module.html[ngx_http_spdy_module]
* nginx (+1.9.5)
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html[ngx_http_v2_module]

To use HTTP_V2 for NGINX you have to check two things:

1.  Be aware that this module may not built in by default, due to a
dependency to the OpenSSL version used on your system. It will be
enabled with the `--with-http_v2_module` configuration parameter during
compilation. The dependencies should be checked automatically. You can
check the presence of `ngx_http_v2_module` by using the command:
`nginx -V 2>&1 | grep http_v2 -o`. A description of how to compile NGINX
to include modules can be found in
https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/extending/compiling[Compiling
Modules].
2.  When changing from
https://www.maxcdn.com/one/visual-glossary/spdy/[SPDY] to
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540[HTTP v2], the NGINX config has to be
changed from `listen 443 ssl spdy;` to `listen 443 ssl http2;`

*2 Caching Metadata*

The `open_file_cache` directive can help you to cache file metadata
information. This can increase performance on high loads respectively
when using eg NFS as backend. That cache can store:

* Open file descriptors, their sizes and modification times;
* Information on existence of directories;
* File lookup errors, such as ``file not found'', ``no read
permission'', and so on.

To configure metadata caching, add following directives either in your
http, server or location block:

[source,nginx]
----
open_file_cache                 max=10000 inactive=5m;
open_file_cache_valid           1m;
open_file_cache_min_uses        1;
open_file_cache_errors          on;
----

[[configure-nginx-to-use-caching-for-owncloud-internal-images-and-thumbnails]]
Configure NGINX to use caching for ownCloud internal images and thumbnails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mechanism speeds up presentation as it shifts requests to NGINX and
minimizes PHP invocations, which otherwise would take place for every
thumbnail or internal image presented every time.

*1 Preparation*

* Create a directory where NGINX will save the cached thumbnails or
internal images. Use any path that fits to your environment. Replace
`/opt/cachezone` in this example with your path created:

[source,bash]
----
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cachezone
sudo chown www-data:www-data /opt/cachezone
----

*2 Configuration*

a.  *Define when to skip the cache:*

* *Option 1:* `map`
+
This is the preferred method. In the `http{}` block, but _outside_ the
`server{}` block:

[source,nginx]
----
# skip_cache, default skip
map $request_uri $skip_cache {
     default              1;
     ~*\/thumbnail.php    0;
     ~*\/apps\/gallery\/  0;
     ~*\/core\/img\/      0;
}
----

* *Option 2:* `if`
+
In the `server{}` block, above the location block mentioned below:

[source,nginx]
----
set $skip_cache 1;
if ($request_uri ~* "thumbnail.php")      { set $skip_cache 0; }
if ($request_uri ~* "/apps/gallery/")     { set $skip_cache 0; }
if ($request_uri ~* "/core/img/")         { set $skip_cache 0; }
----

a.  *General Config:*

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
In case you want to have multiple cache paths with different cache keys,
follow the NGINX documentation where to place the directives. For the
sake of simplicity, we both add them to the `http{}` block.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

* Add _inside_ the `http{}` block:

[source,nginx]
----
fastcgi_cache_path /opt/cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=cachezone:100m 
                   max_size=500m inactive=60m use_temp_path=off;
fastcgi_cache_key $http_cookie$request_method$host$request_uri;
----

* Add _inside_ the `server{}` block the following FastCGI caching
directives, as an example of a configuration:

[source,nginx]
----
location ~ \.php(?:$/) {
    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;

    include fastcgi_params;
    # ...

    ## Begin - FastCGI caching
    fastcgi_ignore_headers  "Cache-Control"
                            "Expires"
                            "Set-Cookie";
    fastcgi_cache_use_stale error
                            timeout
                            updating
                            http_429
                            http_500
                            http_503;
    fastcgi_cache_background_update on;
    fastcgi_no_cache $skip_cache;
    fastcgi_cache_bypass $skip_cache;
    fastcgi_cache cachezone;
    fastcgi_cache_valid  60m;
    fastcgi_cache_methods GET HEAD;
    ## End - FastCGI caching

}
----

*3 Test the configuration*

....
sudo nginx -t
sudo service nginx reload
....

* Open your browser and clear your cache.
* Logon to your ownCloud instance, open the gallery app, move thru your
folders and watch while the thumbnails are generated for the first time.
* You may also watch with eg. `htop` your system load while the
thumbnails are processed.
* Go to another app or logout and relogon.
* Open the gallery app again and browse to the folders you accessed
before. Your thumbnails should appear more or less immediately.
* `htop` will not show up additional load while processing, compared to
the high load before.
