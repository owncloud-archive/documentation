we officially recommend and support:

For the future release of ownCloud 10.1, a minimum php version of 7.1 is
needed. If you use Ubuntu 16.04:

* PHP 7.1 is only available via ppa. To add a ppa to your system, use
this command: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/ppa-name`.
* PHP 7.2 standard installable, but you have to install some mandatory
modules yourself, like http://php.net/manual/en/intro.intl.php[intl].

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux & Centos 7 are 64-bit only.
* Oracle 11g is only supported for the Enterprise edition.
* SQLite is not encouraged for production use.

[[alternative-but-unsupported-options]]
Alternative (But Unsupported) Options
-------------------------------------

If you are not able to use one or more of the above tools, the following
options are also available.

[[web-server]]
Web Server
~~~~~~~~~~

* NGINX with PHP-FPM

[[memory-requirements]]
Memory Requirements
-------------------

Memory requirements for running an ownCloud server are greatly variable,
depending on the numbers of users and files, and volume of server
activity. ownCloud officially requires a minimum of 128MB RAM. But, we
recommend a minimum of 512MB.

_Consideration for low memory environments_

Scanning of files is committed internally in 10k files chunks. Based on
tests, server memory usage for scanning greater than 10k files uses
about 75MB of additional memory.

[[database-requirements]]
Database Requirements
---------------------

The following are currently required if youâ€™re running ownCloud together
with a MySQL or MariaDB database:

* Disabled or `BINLOG_FORMAT = MIXED` or `BINLOG_FORMAT = ROW`
configured Binary Logging (See: db-binlog-label)
* InnoDB storage engine (The MyISAM storage engine is not supported,
see: db-storage-engine-label)
* ``READ COMMITED'' transaction isolation level (See:
db-transaction-label)
