options are also available.

[[web-server]]
Web Server
~~~~~~~~~~

* NGINX with PHP-FPM

[[memory-requirements]]
Memory Requirements
-------------------

Memory requirements for running an ownCloud server are greatly variable,
depending on the numbers of users and files, and volume of server
activity. ownCloud officially requires a minimum of 128MB RAM. But, we
recommend a minimum of 512MB.

[NOTE] 
.Consideration for low memory environments 
====
Scanning of files is committed internally in 10k files chunks. 
Based on tests, server memory usage for scanning greater than 10k files uses about 75MB of additional memory.
====

[[database-requirements]]
Database Requirements
---------------------

The following are currently required if you’re running ownCloud together
with a MySQL or MariaDB database:

* Disabled or `BINLOG_FORMAT = MIXED` or `BINLOG_FORMAT = ROW`
configured Binary Logging (See: db-binlog-label)
* InnoDB storage engine (The MyISAM storage engine is not supported,
see: db-storage-engine-label)
* ``READ COMMITED'' transaction isolation level (See:
db-transaction-label)
