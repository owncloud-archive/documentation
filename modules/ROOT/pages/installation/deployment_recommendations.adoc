Deployment Recommendations
==========================

What is the best way to install and maintain ownCloud? The answer to
that is, as always: _``it depends''_.

This is because every ownCloud customer has their own particular needs
and IT infrastructure. However, both ownCloud and the LAMP stack are
highly-configurable. Given that, in this document we present a set of
general recommendations, followed by three typical scenarios, and finish
up with making best-practice recommendations for both software and
hardware.

The recommendations presented here are based on a standard ownCloud
installation, one without any particular _apps_, _themes_, or _code
changes_. But, server load is dependent upon the number of _clients_,
_files_, and _user activity_, as well as other usage patterns. Given
that, these recommendations are only a rule of thumb based on our
experience, as well as that of one of our customers.

[[general-recommendations]]
General Recommendations
-----------------------

* Operating system: Linux.
* Web server: Apache 2.4.
* Database: MySQL/MariaDB with InnoDB storage engine (MyISAM is not
supported, see: db-storage-engine-label)
* PHP 5.6+.
* Consider setting up a scale-out deployment, or using
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/user_manual/files/federated_cloud_sharing.html[Federated
Cloud Sharing] to keep individual ownCloud instances to a manageable
size.

Whatever the size of your organization, always keep one thing in mind:
_The amount of data stored in ownCloud will only grow. So plan ahead._

[[owncloud-administrators-must-have-command-line-or-cron-access]]
ownCloud Administrators Must Have Command Line or Cron Access
-------------------------------------------------------------

We only recommend using hosts that provide command-line or Cron access
(ideally both) _to ownCloud administrators_, for three key reasons:

1.  Without command-line access,
OCC commands <../configuration/server/occ_command>, required for
administrative tasks such as repairs and upgrades, are not available.
2.  Without crontab access, you cannot run background jobs reliably.
ajax/cron.php <ajax_cron_label> is available, but it is not reliable
enough, because it only runs when people are using the web UI.
Additionally, ownCloud relies heavily on
background jobs <available_background_jobs_label> especially for
long-running operations, which will likely cause PHP timeouts.
3.  PHP timeout values are often low. Having low timeout settings can
break long-running operations, such as moving a huge folder.

[[scenario-1-small-workgroups-and-departments]]
Scenario 1: Small Workgroups and Departments
--------------------------------------------

This recommendation applies if you meet the following criteria:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Value
|Number of users |Up to 150 users

|Storage size |100 GB to 10TB

|High availability level |Zero-downtime backups via Btrfs snapshots,
component

| |failure leads to interruption of service. Alternate

| |backup scheme on other filesystems: nightly backups

| |— with service interruption.
|=======================================================================

[[recommended-system-requirements]]
Recommended System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One machine running the application, web, and database server, as well
as local storage. Authentication via an existing LDAP or Active
Directory server.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/installation/deprecs-1.png[image]

[[components]]
Components
^^^^^^^^^^

One server with at least 2 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, and local storage as
needed.

[[operating-system]]
Operating system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enterprise-grade Linux distribution with full support from an operating
system vendor. We recommend both RedHat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server 12.

[[ssl-configuration]]
SSL Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SSL termination is done in Apache. A standard SSL certificate is
required to be installed according to
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ssl/ssl_howto.html[the official Apache
documentation].

[[load-balancer]]
Load Balancer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

None.

[[database]]
Database
^^^^^^^^

MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL. We currently recommend MySQL / MariaDB,
as our customers have had good experiences when moving to a Galera
cluster to scale the DB. If using either MySQL or MariaDB, you must use
the InnoDB storage engine as MyISAM is not supported, see:
db-storage-engine-label

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
If you are using MaxScale/Galera, then you need to use at least version
1.3.0. In earlier versions, there is a bug where the value of
`last_insert_id` is not routed to the master node. This bug can cause
loops within ownCloud and corrupt database rows. You can find out more
information https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-220[in the issue
documentation].
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

[[backup]]
Backup
^^^^^^

Install ownCloud, the ownCloud data directory, and database on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs[a Btrfs filesystem]. Make regular
snapshots at desired intervals for zero downtime backups. Mount DB
partitions with the ``nodatacow'' option to prevent fragmentation.

Alternatively, you can make nightly backups — with service interruption
— as follows:

1.  Shut down Apache.
2.  Create database dump.
3.  Push data directory to backup.
4.  Push database dump to backup.
5.  Start Apache.

After these steps have been completed, then, optionally, rsync the
backup to either an external backup storage or tape backup. See the
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/maintenance/index.html[Maintenance]
section of the Administration manual for tips on backups and restores.

[[authentication]]
Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

User authentication via one or several LDAP or Active Directory (AD)
servers. See
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/user_auth_ldap.html[User
Authentication with LDAP] for information on configuring ownCloud to use
LDAP and AD.

[[session-management]]
Session Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local session management on the application server. PHP sessions are
stored in a temporary filesystem, mounted at the operating
system-specific session storage location. You can find out where that is
by running `grep -R 'session.save_path' /etc/php5` and then add it to
the `/etc/fstab` file, for example:

[source,console]
----
echo "tmpfs /var/lib/php5/pool-www tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0" >> /etc/fstab``.
----

[[memory-caching]]
Memory Caching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A memory cache speeds up server performance, and ownCloud supports four
of them. Refer to
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/server/caching_configuration.html[Configuring
Memory Caching] for information on selecting and configuring a memory
cache.

[[storage]]
Storage
^^^^^^^

[[redis-configuration]]
Redis Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Redis in a master-slave configuration is
http://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/cold-warm-hot-server[a
hot failover setup], and is usually sufficient. A slave can be omitted
if high availability is provided via other means. And when it is, in the
event of a failure, restarting Redis typically occurs quickly enough.
Regarding Redis cluster, we don’t, usually, recommend it, as it requires
a greater level of both maintenance and management in the case of
failure. A single Redis server, however, just needs to be rebooted, in
the event of failure.

[[known-issues]]
Known Issues

[[deadlocks-when-using-mariadb-galera-cluster]]
Deadlocks When Using MariaDB Galera Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’re using http://galeracluster.com[MariaDB Galera Cluster] with
your ownCloud installation, you may encounter deadlocks when you attempt
to sync a large number of files. You may also encounter database errors,
such as this one:

[source,console]
----
SQLSTATE[40001]: Serialization failure: 1213 Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction
----

The issue,
https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/14757#issuecomment-223492913[identified
by Michael Roth], is caused when MariaDB Galera cluster sends write
requests to all servers in the cluster;
http://severalnines.com/blog/avoiding-deadlocks-galera-set-haproxy-single-node-writes-and-multi-node-reads[here
is a detailed explanation]. The solution is to send all write requests
to a single server, instead of all of them.

'''''

[[set-wsrep_sync_wait-to-1-on-all-galera-cluster-nodes]]
Set wsrep_sync_wait to 1 on all Galera Cluster nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[what-the-parameter-does]]
What the parameter does
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When enabled, the node triggers causality checks in response to certain
types of queries. During the check, the node blocks new queries while
the database server catches up with all updates made in the cluster to
the point where the check begun. Once it reaches this point, the node
executes the original query.

[[why-enable-it]]
Why enable it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Galera Cluster write operation is sent to the master while reads are
retrieved from the slaves. Since Galera Cluster replication is, by
default, not strictly synchronous it could happen that items are
requested before the replication has actually taken place.

This setting is disabled by default.

See the Galera Cluster WSREP documentation for more details.
