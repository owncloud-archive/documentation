Local storage provides the ability to mount any directory on your ownCloud server that is:

- Outside of your ownCloud ``data/`` directory
- Both readable and writable by your HTTP server user 

Since this is a significant security risk, Local storage is only configurable via the ownCloud admin settings. 
Non-admin users cannot create Local storage mounts. 
 
.. note::
   See :ref:`strong_perms_label` for information on correct file permissions, and find your HTTP user :ref:`label-phpinfo`.
   
To manage Local storage, navigate to ``admin``, and then to ``Storage``. 
You can see an example in the screenshot below.

In the **Folder name** field enter the folder name that you want to appear on your ownCloud Files page.
In the **Configuration** field enter the full file path of the directory you want to mount.
In the **Available for** field enter the users or groups who have permission to access the mount;  by default all users have access.

In addition to these steps, you have to ensure that Local storage is enabled in your ownCloud installationâ€™s ``config/config.php`` file.
It should have the following configuration:

.. code-block:: php

  'files_external_allow_create_new_local' => 'true',

.. note::
   See :doc:`../external_storage_configuration_gui` for additional mount options and information, and :doc:`auth_mechanisms` for more information on authentication schemes.
