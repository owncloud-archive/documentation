======================

If you don't know a lot about Linux, only have a small IT staff, or are your IT staff — even if that's only in your spare time — the ownCloud X Appliance will let you get started using ownCloud quickly and easily.

The Appliance:

- Provides a pre-packaged, easy to deploy ownCloud, ready for you in most popular virtual machine formats, including *ESX*, *VirtualBox*, *KVM* and *VMware*.
- Contains the ownCloud 10 virtual image, and all the additional software you need to get up and running on ownCloud in minutes; this includes: *ownCloud X Server and Enterprise Apps*, *Apache 2*, *PHP*, and *MySQL*.
- Scales up to 500 users. Depending on the intensity and pattern of use, this can vary from 400 up to 600 users.

.. note:: 
   Some configurations, such as SAML IDPs, or LDAP or AD instances, may need additional configuration to connect.
