=======================
Manual ownCloud Upgrade
=======================

.. note::
   If you’re not comfortable performing a manual upgrade, you can also use your
   Linux distribution’s :doc:`package manager <package_upgrade>`, or use
   :doc:`the Updater App <update>`.

Backup Your Existing Installation
---------------------------------

First, :doc:`backup <backup>` the following items:

- The ownCloud server data directory
- The ``config.php`` file
- All 3rd party apps
- The ownCloud server database

::

  # This example assumes Ubuntu Linux and MariaDB
  cp -rv /var/www/owncloud /opt/backup/owncloud && mysqldump <db_name> > /opt/backup/backup-file.sql

Review Third-Party Apps
-----------------------

Review any installed third-party apps for compatibility with the new ownCloud release.
Ensure that they are all disabled before beginning the upgrade.
After the upgrade is complete re-enable any which are compatible with the new release.

.. warning::
   Install unsupported apps at your own risk.

Check ownCloud's Mandatory Requirements
---------------------------------------

:ref:`ownCloud's mandatory requirements <prerequisites_label>` (such as PHP versions and extensions) can change from one version to the next. 
Ensure that you review them and update your server(s), if required, before upgrading ownCloud. 

Enable Maintenance Mode
-----------------------

Put your server in :doc:`maintenance mode <enable_maintenance>` and disable :ref:`Cron jobs <cron_job_label>`.
Doing so prevents new logins, locks the sessions of logged-in users, and displays a status screen so that users know what is happening.

There are two ways to enable maintenance mode.
The preferred method is to use the :doc:`occ command <../configuration/server/occ_command>` — which you must run as your webserver user.
The other way is by entering your ``config.php`` file and changing ``'maintenance' => false,`` to ``'maintenance' => true,``.
::

  # Enable maintenance mode using the occ command.
  sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --on

  # Disable Cron jobs
  sudo service cron stop

Stop the Webserver
------------------

With those steps completed, stop your webserver.

::

  sudo service apache2 stop

Download the Latest Installation
--------------------------------

Download the latest ownCloud server release from `owncloud.org/install/`_ into an empty directory **outside** of your current installation.

.. note::
   Enterprise users must download their new ownCloud archives from their accounts on `<https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud/>`_.

Setup the New Installation
--------------------------

Not all installations are the same, so we encourage you to take one of two paths to upgrade your ownCloud installation.
These are `the standard upgrade` and `the power user upgrade`.

If you're reasonably new to ownCloud, or not too familiar with upgrading an ownCloud installation, please follow the standard upgrade.
Otherwise, take the approach that you're most comfortable with, likely the power
user upgrade.

.. note::
   Regardless of which approach that you take, they will both assume that your existing ownCloud installation is located in the default location: ``/var/www/owncloud``.

The Standard Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete all files and folders in your existing ownCloud directory (``/var/www/owncloud``) — **except** ``data`` and ``config``.

.. attention:: Don't keep the ``apps`` directory.

With those files and folders deleted, extract the archive of the latest ownCloud server, over the top of your existing installation.

::

  # Extract the .tar.bz2 archive
  tar -jxf owncloud-10.0.3.tar.bz2 -C /var/www/

  # Extract the zip archive
  unzip -q owncloud-10.0.3.zip -d /var/www/

The Power User Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rename your current ownCloud directory, for example, from ``owncloud`` to ``owncloud-old``.
Extract the unpacked ownCloud server directory and its contents to the location of your original ownCloud installation.
::

  # Assumes that the new release was unpacked into /tmp/
  mv /tmp/owncloud /var/www/

With the new source files now in place of the old ones, next copy the ``config.php`` file from your old ownCloud directory to your new ownCloud directory.
::

  cp /var/www/owncloud-old/config/config.php /var/www/owncloud/config/config.php

If you keep your ``data/`` directory *inside* your ``owncloud/`` directory, copy it from your old version of ownCloud to your new version.
If you keep it *outside* of your ``owncloud/`` directory, then you don't have to do anything with it, because its location is configured in your original ``config.php``, and none of the upgrade steps touch it.

Disable Core Apps
-----------------

Before the upgrade can run, several apps need to be disabled, if they’re enabled, before the upgrade can succeed.
These are: *activity*, *files_pdfviewer*, *files_texteditor*, and *gallery*.
The following command provides an example of how to do so.

::

  sudo -u www-data php occ app:disable activity
  sudo -u www-data php occ app:disable files_pdfviewer
  sudo -u www-data php occ app:disable files_texteditor
  sudo -u www-data php occ app:disable gallery

Market and Marketplace App Upgrades
-----------------------------------

Before getting too far into the upgrade process, please be aware of how the Market app and its configuration options affect the upgrade process.

- The Market app is not upgraded if it is either disabled (because ``appstoreenabled`` is set to ``false``) or it is not available.
- If ``upgrade.automatic-app-update`` is set to ``false`` apps installed from the Marketplace are not automatically upgraded.

In addition to these two points, if there are installed apps (whether compatible or incompatible with the next version, or missing source code) and the Market app is enabled, but there is no available internet connection, then these apps will need to be manually updated once the upgrade is finished.

Start the Upgrade
-----------------

With the apps disabled and the webserver started, launch the upgrade process from the command line.
::

  # Here is an example on CentOS Linux
  sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade

.. note::
   The optional parameter to skip migration tests during this step was removed in oC 10.0.
   See :ref:`migration_test_label` for background information.
   See :doc:`../configuration/server/occ_command` to learn more about the occ command.

The upgrade operation can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the size of your installation.
When it is finished you will see either a success message, or an error message which indicates why the process did not complete successfully.

Copy Old Apps
-------------

If you are using 3rd party applications, look in your new ``/var/www/owncloud/apps/`` directory to see if they are there.
If not, copy them from your old ``apps/`` directory to your new one, and make sure that the directory permissions are the same as for the other ones.

Disable Maintenance Mode
------------------------

Assuming your upgrade succeeded, next disable maintenance mode.
The simplest way is by using occ from the command line.

::

   sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --off

Restart the Webserver
---------------------

With all that done, restart your web server.
::

  sudo service apache2 start

Finalize the Installation
-------------------------

With maintenance mode disabled, login and:

- Re-enable cron jobs
- Check that the version number reflects the new installation. It's visible at the bottom of your Admin page. 
- Check that your other settings are correct. 
- Go to the Apps page and review the core apps to make sure the right ones are enabled. 
- Re-enable your third-party apps. 
- :ref:`Apply strong permissions <strong_perms_label>` to your ownCloud directories.

.. _migration_test_label:

Test the Upgrade
----------------

Previous versions of ownCloud included a migration test.
ownCloud first ran a migration simulation by copying the ownCloud database and performing the upgrade on the copy, to ensure that the migration would succeed.

Then the copied tables were deleted after the upgrade was completed.
This doubled the upgrade time, so admins could skip this test (by risking a failed upgrade) with ``php occ upgrade --skip-migration-test``.

The migration test has been removed from ownCloud 9.2. ownCloud server admins should have current backups before migration, and rely on backups to correct any problems from the migration.

Reverse Upgrade
---------------

If you need to reverse your upgrade, see :doc:`restore`.

Troubleshooting
---------------

When upgrading ownCloud and you are running MySQL or MariaDB with binary logging enabled, your upgrade may fail with these errors in your MySQL/MariaDB log::

 An unhandled exception has been thrown:
 exception 'PDOException' with the message 'SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1665
 Cannot execute statement: impossible to write to binary log since
 BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT and at least one table uses a storage engine limited to row-based logging. InnoDB is limited to row-logging when transaction isolation level is READ COMMITTED or READ UNCOMMITTED.'

Please refer to :ref:`db-binlog-label` on how to correctly configure your environment.

Occasionally, *files do not show up after an upgrade*. A rescan of the files can help::

 sudo -u www-data php console.php files:scan --all

See `the owncloud.org support page <https://owncloud.org/support>`_ for further resources for both home and enterprise users.

Sometimes, ownCloud can get *stuck in a upgrade*.
This is usually due to the process taking too long and encountering a PHP time-out. Stop the upgrade process this way::

 sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --off

Then start the manual process::

 sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade

If this does not work properly, try the repair function::

 sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:repair
