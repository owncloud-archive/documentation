ownCloud Enterprise users have the option of enabling `the Password Policy app`_. 
This application enables administrators to define password requirements, including: *minimum characters*, *numbers*, *capital letters*, and more, for all kinds of password endpoints, such as for user passwords and public link sharing passwords. 
Moreover the admin can enforce expiration dates for public link shares.

ownCloud Community Edition users, however, can use `the Security app`_, available from the ownCloud Marketplace.
It supports configuring a basic password policy, which includes:

#. Setting a password length
#. Whether to enforce at least one upper and lower case character, a numerical character and a special character.
