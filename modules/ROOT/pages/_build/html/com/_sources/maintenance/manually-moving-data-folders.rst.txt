How To Manually Move a Data Directory
=====================================

If you need to move your ownCloud data directory from its current location to
somewhere else, here is a manual process that you can take to make it happen.

.. NOTE:: 
   This example assumes that:

   - The current folder is: `/var/www/owncloud/data`
   - The new folder is: `/mnt/owncloud`
   - You're using Apache as your webserver

1. Stop Apache
2. Use rsync to sync the files from the current folder to the new one 
3. Create a symbolic link from the new directory to the old one 
4. Double-check `the directory permissions`_ on the new directory 
5. Restart Apache

To save time, here's the commands which you can copy and use::

  apachectl -k stop 
  rsync -avz /var/www/owncloud/data /mnt/owncloud
  ln -s /mnt/owncloud /var/www/owncloud/data
  apachectl -k graceful 

.. note:: 
   If you're on CentOS/Fedora, try ``systemctl restart httpd``.
   If you're on Debian/Ubuntu try ``sudo systemctl restart apache2``
   To learn more about the systemctl command, please refer to `the systemd essentials guide`_

Fix Hardcoded Database Path Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update the oc_storages table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to manually change the location of the data folder in the database,
run the SQL below:

.. code-block:: sql
   
  UPDATE oc_storages SET id='local::/mnt/owncloud' 
    WHERE id='local::/var/www/owncloud/data/';

Update the oc_accounts table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You next need to update the ``home`` column in the ``oc_accounts`` table. 
This column contains the absolute path for user folders, e.g., ``/mnt/data/files/admin``.
Assuming that the new home directory is: ``/mnt/data/files/super-admin``, and that the user’s id is 1, you could change it using the following SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql
   
  UPDATE oc_accounts SET home='/mnt/data/files/super-admin' 
    WHERE id=1;

.. note:: 
   Please don’t copy and paste this example verbatim — nor any of the others. 
   It, and the others, are provided only as guides to what you should or could do. 

Update the oc_jobs table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The next area to check is the `oc_jobs` table. 
The logrotate process may have hard-coded a non-standard (or old) value for the data path. 
To check it, run the SQL below and see if any results are returned:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT * FROM oc_jobs 
    WHERE class = 'OC\Log\Rotate';

If any are, run the SQL below to update them, changing the value as appropriate.

.. code-block:: sql

  UPDATE oc_jobs SET argument = '/your/new/data/path' 
    WHERE id = <id of the incorrect record>;

Fix Application Settings 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One thing worth noting is that individual apps may reference the data directory
separate from the core system configuration. If so, then you will need to find
which applications do this, and change them as needed. 

For example, if you listed the application configuration by running `occ
config:list`, then you might see output similar to that below:

.. code-block:: json

  {
      "apps": {
          "fictitious": {
              "enabled": "yes",
              "installed_version": "2.3.2",
              "types": "filesystem",
              "datadir": "var/www/owncloud/data"
          }
      }
  }

Here, the "fictitious" application references the data directory as being set to
`var/www/owncloud/data`. So you would have to change the value by using the
`config:app:set` option. Here's an example of how you would update the setting:

.. code-block:: console

  occ config:app:set --value /mnt/owncloud fictitious datadir
