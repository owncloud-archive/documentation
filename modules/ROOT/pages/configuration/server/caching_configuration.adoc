Memory Caching
==============

You can significantly improve ownCloud server performance by using
memory caching. This is the process of storing frequently-requested
objects in-memory for faster retrieval later. There are two types of
memory caching available:

*A PHP opcode Cache (OPcache):* An opcode cache stores compiled PHP
scripts so they don’t need to be re-compiled every time they are called.
These compiled PHP scripts are stored in-memory, on the server on which
they’re compiled.

*A Data Cache:* A data cache stores copies of _data_, _templates_, and
other types of _information-based files_. Depending on the cache
implementation, it can be either _local_, or specific, to one server, or
_distributed_ across multiple servers. This cache type is ideal when you
have a scale-out installation.

[[supported-caching-backends]]
Supported Caching Backends
--------------------------

The caching backends supported by ownCloud are:

* APCu <apcu-label>: This is a local cache for systems running PHP 5.6
and up. APCu 4.0.6 and up is required. Alternatively you can use
the Zend OPCache. However, *it is not a data cache*, only an opcode
cache.
* Redis <redis-label>: This is a distributed cache for multi-server
ownCloud installations. Version 2.2.6 or higher of the PHP Redis
extension is required.
* Memcached <memcached-label>: This is a distributed cache for
multi-server ownCloud installations.

You may use _both_ a local and a distributed cache. The recommended
ownCloud caches are APCu and Redis.

If you do not install and enable a local memory cache you will see a
warning on your ownCloud admin page. If you enable only a distributed
cache in your `config.php` (`memcache.distributed`) and not a local
cache (`memcache.local`) you will still see the cache warning.

[[cache-directory-location]]
Cache Directory Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cache directory defaults to `data/$user/cache` where `$user` is the
current user. You may use the `'cache_path'` directive in `config.php`
(See config_sample_php_parameters) to select a different location.

[[cache-types]]
Cache Types
-----------

[[apcu]]
APCu
~~~~

PHP 5.6 and up include the Zend OPcache in core, and on most Linux
distributions it is enabled by default. However, it _does not_ bundle a
data cache. Given that, we recommend that you use APCu instead. APCu is
a data cache _and_ is available in most Linux distributions.

[[installing-apcu]]
Installing APCu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[source,console]
----
# On RedHat/CentOS/Fedora systems running PHP 5.6 
yum install rh-php56-php-devel
pecl install apcu 

# On RedHat/CentOS/Fedora systems running PHP 7.0 
yum install rh-php70-php-devel
pecl install apcu 

# On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint systems
apt-get install php-apcu 
----

On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, the APCu version is 4.0.2. This is too old to use
with ownCloud, which requires ownCloud 4.0.6+. You can install 4.0.7
from Ubuntu backports with the following command:

[source,console]
----
apt-get install php5-apcu/trusty-backports
----

After APCu’s installed, enable the extension by creating a configuration
file for it, using the following commands.

[source,console]
----
cat << EOF > /etc/opt/rh/rh-php70/php.d/20-apcu.ini
; APCu php extension
extension=apcu.so
EOF
----

With that done, assuming that you don’t encounter any errors, restart
Apache and the extension is ready to use.

[[redis]]
Redis
~~~~~

http://redis.io/[Redis] is an excellent modern memory cache to use for
both distributed caching and as a local cache for
Transactional File Locking <../../configuration/files/files_locking_transactional>,
because it guarantees that cached objects are available for as long as
they are needed.

The Redis PHP module must be at least version 2.2.6 or higher. If you
are running a Linux distribution that does not package the supported
versions of this module — or does not package Redis at all — see
install_redis_label.

Debian Jessie users, please see this
https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/20675#issuecomment-159202901[GitHub
discussion] if you have problems with LDAP authentication when using
Redis.

[[installing-redis-on-debian-based-distributions]]
Installing Redis on Debian-based Distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint run the following command:

[source,console]
----
apt-get install redis-server php5-redis
----

The installer will automatically launch Redis and configure it to launch
at startup.

If you’re running ownCloud on Ubuntu 14.04, which does not package the
required version of `php5-redis`, then work through
https://www.techandme.se/how-to-configure-redis-cache-in-ubuntu-14-04-with-owncloud/[this
guide on Tech and Me] to see how to install and configure it.

[[installing-redis-on-redhat-centos-and-fedora]]
Installing Redis on RedHat, CentOS, and Fedora
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On RedHat, CentOS, and Fedora run the following commands to install
Redis:

[source,console]
----
yum install rh-php70-php-devel rh-redis32-redis
pecl install redis 
----

Unlike on Debian-based distributions, Redis will not start automatically
on _RedHat_, _Centos_, and _Fedora_. Given that, you must use your
service manager to both start Redis, and to launch it at boot time as a
daemon. To do so, run the following commands:

[source,console]
----
systemctl start rh-redis32-redis
systemctl enable rh-redis32-redis
----

You can verify that the Redis daemon is running using either of the
following two commands:

[source,console]
----
ps ax | grep redis
netstat -tlnp | grep redis
----

When it’s running, enable the Redis extension by creating a
configuration file for it, using the following commands.

[source,console]
----
cat << EOF > /etc/opt/rh/rh-php70/php.d/20-redis.ini
; Redis php extension
extension=redis.so
EOF
----

After that, assuming that you don’t encounter any errors, restart Apache
and the extension is ready to use.

[[additional-notes-for-redis-vs.-apcu-on-memory-caching]]
Additional notes for Redis vs. APCu on Memory Caching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

APCu is faster at local caching than Redis. If you have enough memory,
use APCu for memory caching and Redis for file locking. If you are low
on memory, use Redis for both.

[[installing-redis-on-other-distributions]]
Installing Redis on other distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These instructions are adaptable for any distribution that does not
package the supported version, or that does not package Redis at all,
such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and RedHat Enterprise Linux.

The https://pecl.php.net/package/redis[Redis PHP module] must be at
least version 2.2.6.

[[on-debianmintubuntu]]
On Debian/Mint/Ubuntu

Use `apt-cache` to see the available `php5-redis` version, or the
version of your installed package:

[source,console]
----
apt-cache policy php5-redis
----

[[on-centos-and-fedora]]
On CentOS and Fedora

The `yum` command shows available and installed version information:

[source,console]

[[clearing-the-redis-cache]]
Clearing the Redis Cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Redis cache can be flushed from the command-line using
https://redis.io/topics/rediscli[the redis-cli tool], as in the
following example:

....
sudo redis-cli
SELECT <dbIndex>
FLUSHDB
....

`<dbIndex>` is the number of Redis database where the cache is stored.
It is zero by default at ownCloud. To check what yours is currently set
to, check the `dbindex` value in `config/config.php`. Here’s an example
of what to look for:

[source,php]
----
'redis': {
    'host' => 'localhost',  // Can also be a unix domain socket => '/tmp/redis.sock'
    'port' => 6379,
    'timeout' => 0,
    'password' => '',       // Optional, if not defined no password will be used.
    'dbindex' => 0          // Optional, if undefined SELECT will not run and will
                            // use Redis Server's default DB Index.
},

[[memcached]]
Memcached
~~~~~~~~~

Memcached is a reliable old-timer for shared caching on distributed
servers. It performs well with ownCloud with one exception: it is not
suitable to use with
Transactional File Locking <../../configuration/files/files_locking_transactional>.
This is because it does not store locks, and data can disappear from the
cache at any time. Given that, Redis is the best memory cache to use.

Be sure to install the *memcached* PHP module, and not _memcache_, as in
the following examples. ownCloud supports only the *memcached* PHP
module.

[[installing-memcached]]
Installing Memcached
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[on-debianubuntumint]]
On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
+++++++++++++++++++++

On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint run the following command:

[source,console]
----
apt-get install memcached php5-memcached
----

The installer will automatically start `memcached` and configure it to
launch at startup.

[[on-redhatcentosfedora]]
On RedHat/CentOS/Fedora
+++++++++++++++++++++++

On RedHat/CentOS/Fedora run the following command:

[source,console]
----
yum install memcached php-pecl-memcache 
----

It will not start Memcached automatically after the installation or on
subsequent reboots as a daemon, so you must do so yourself . To do so,
run the following command:

[source,console]
----
systemctl start memcached
systemctl enable memcached
----

You can verify that the Memcached daemon is running using one of the
following commands:

[source,console]
----
ps ax | grep memcached
netstat -tlnp | grep memcached
----

With the extension installed, you now need to configure it, by creating
a configuration file for it. You can do so using the command below,
substituting `FILE_PATH` with one from the list below the command.

[source,console]
----
cat << EOF > FILE_PATH
; Memcached PHP extension
extension=memcached.so
EOF
----

[[configuration-file-paths]]
Configuration File Paths

|7.0 |`/etc/opt/rh/rh-php70/php.d/25-memcached.ini`
|==================================================

After that, assuming that you don’t encounter any errors:

1.  Restart your Web server
2.  Add the appropriate entries to `config.php` (which you can find an
example of below)
3.  Refresh your ownCloud admin page

[[clearing-the-memcached-cache]]
Clearing the Memcached Cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Memcached cache can be flushed from the command-line using a range
of common Linux/UNIX tools, including netcat and telnet. The following
example uses telnet to login, run
https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Commands#flushall[the
flush_all command], and logout:

....
telnet localhost 11211
flush_all
quit
....

For more information see:

[[configuring-memory-caching]]
Configuring Memory Caching
--------------------------

Memory caches must be explicitly configured in ownCloud by:

1.  Installing and enabling your desired cache (whether that be the PHP
extension and/or the caching server).
2.  Adding the appropriate entry to ownCloud’s `config.php`.

See config_sample_php_parameters for an overview of all possible config
parameters. After installing and enabling your chosen memory cache,
verify that it is active by running label-phpinfo.

[[apcu-configuration]]
APCu Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use APCu, add this line to `config.php`:

[source,php]
----
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
----

With that done, refresh your ownCloud admin page, and the cache warning
should disappear.

[[redis-configuration]]
Redis Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example `config.php` configuration uses Redis for the local server
cache:

[source,php]
----
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'redis' => [
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'port' => 6379,
],
----

_________________________________________________________________________
`memcache.locking' => `OCMemcacheRedis', // Add this for best
performance
_________________________________________________________________________

If you want to connect to Redis configured to listen on an Unix socket,
which is recommended if Redis is running on the same system as ownCloud,
use this example configuration:

[source,php]
----
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'redis' => [
     'host' => '/var/run/redis/redis.sock',
     'port' => 0,
],
----

Redis is very configurable; consult http://redis.io/documentation[the
Redis documentation] to learn more.

[[memcached-configuration]]
Memcached Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses APCu for the local cache, Memcached as the distributed
memory cache, and lists all the servers in the shared cache pool with
their port numbers:

[source,php]
----
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
'memcache.distributed' => '\OC\Memcache\Memcached',
'memcached_servers' => [
     ['localhost', 11211],
     ['server1.example.com', 11211],
     ['server2.example.com', 11211], 
 ],

[[small-organization-single-server-setup]]
Small Organization, Single-server Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use APCu for local caching, Redis for file locking

],
----

[[large-organization-clustered-setup]]
Large Organization, Clustered Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use Redis for everything except a local memory cache. Use the server’s
IP address or hostname so that it is accessible to other hosts:

[source,php]
----
'memcache.distributed' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'memcache.locking' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
'redis' => [
    'host' => 'server1',      // hostname example
    'host' => '12.34.56.78',  // IP address example
    'port' => 6379,
],
----

[[configuring-transactional-file-locking]]
Configuring Transactional File Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transactional File Locking <../../configuration/files/files_locking_transactional>
prevents simultaneous file saving. To use it, you have to enable it in
`config.php` as in the following example, which uses Redis as the cache
backend:

[source,php]
----
'filelocking.enabled' => true,
'memcache.locking' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
'redis' => [
     'host' => 'localhost',
     'port' => 6379,
     'timeout' => 0.0,
     'password' => '', // Optional, if not defined no password will be used.
 ],
----

For enhanced security it is recommended to configure Redis to require a
password. See http://redis.io/topics/security for more information.

[[caching-exceptions]]
Caching Exceptions
------------------

If ownCloud is configured to use either Memcached or Redis as a memory
cache, please be aware that you may encounter issues with functionality.
When these occur, it is usually a result of PHP being incorrectly
configured, or the relevant PHP extension not being available.

In the table below, you can see all of the known reasons for reduced or
broken functionality related to caching.

[width="100%",cols="41%,59%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setup/Configuration |Result
|If file locking is enabled, but the locking cache class is missing,
then an exception will appear in the web UI |The application will not be
usable

|If file locking is enabled and the locking cache is configured, but the
PHP module missing. |There will be a white page/exception in web UI. It
will be a full page issue, and the application will not be usable

|All enabled, but the Redis server is not running |The application will
be usable. But any file operation will return a *``500 Redis went
away''* exception

|If Memcache is configured for ``local'' and ``distributed'', but the
class is missing |There will be a white page and an exception written to
the logs, This is because autoloading needs the missing class. So there
is no way to show a page
