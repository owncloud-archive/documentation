= Virus Scanner Support

[[overview]]
== Overview

http://www.clamav.net/index.html[ClamAV] is the only _officially_
supported virus scanner available for use with ownCloud. It:

* Operates on all major operating systems, including _Windows_, _Linux_,
and _Mac_
* Detects all forms of malware including _Trojan horses_, _viruses_, and
_worms_
* Scans _compressed files_, _executables_, _image files_, _Flash_,
_PDF_, as well as many others

What’s more, ClamAV's Freshclam daemon automatically updates its malware
signature database at scheduled intervals. However, other scanners can
be used, so long as they:

1.  Can receive data streams via pipe on the command-line and return an
exit code
2.  Return a parsable result on stdout

[[how-clamav-works-with-owncloud]]
=== How ClamAV Works With ownCloud

Before you install and configure ClamAV, here is a bit of background
which may be handy to know. ownCloud integrates with anti-virus tools by
connecting to them via:

* A URL and port
* A socket
* Streaming the data from the command-line via a pipe with a configured
executable

In the case of ClamAV, ownCloud’s Antivirus extension sends files as
streams to a ClamAV service (which can be on the same ownCloud server or
another server within the same network) which in turn scans them and
returns a result to stdout.

NOTE: Individual chunks are *not* scanned. The whole file is scanned when it is moved to the final location.

The information is then parsed or an exit code is evaluated if no result
is available to determine the response from the scan. Based on
ownCloud’s evaluation of the response (or exit code) an appropriate
action is then taken, such as recording a log message or deleting the
file.

NOTE: Scanner exit status rules are used to handle errors when ClamAV is run in CLI mode. Scanner output rules are used in daemon/socket mode.

[[things-to-note]]
Things To Note
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Files are checked when they are uploaded or updated (whether because
they were edited or saved) but _not_ when they are downloaded.
2.  ownCloud doesn’t support a cache of previously scanned files.
3.  If the app is either not configured or is misconfigured, then it
rejects file uploads.
4.  If ClamAV is unavailable, then the app rejects file uploads.
5.  A file size limit applies both to background jobs and to file
uploads.

[[configuring-the-clamav-antivirus-scanner]]
== Configuring the ClamAV Antivirus Scanner

You can configure your ownCloud server to automatically run a virus scan
on newly-uploaded files using the
https://github.com/owncloud/files_antivirus[Antivirus App for Files].

NOTE: ClamAV must be installed before installing and configuring Antivirus App for Files.

[[installing-clamav]]
== Installing ClamAV

As always, Linux distributions install and configure ClamAV in different
ways. Below you can find the instructions for installing it on Debian or
Red Hat-based distributions.

[[debian-ubuntu-linux-mint]]
Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Debian, Ubuntu, and their many variants, install ClamAV with the
following command:

....
sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon
....

This automatically creates the default configuration files and launches
the `clamd` and `freshclam` daemons. You shouldn’t have to do anything
else, though it is a good idea to review the ClamAV documentation, as
well ClamAV’s settings in `/etc/clamav/`.

[[red-hat-7-and-centos-7]]
Red Hat 7 and CentOS 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Red Hat 7 and related systems, you must install the ``Extra Packages
for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)'' repository, and then install ClamAV. To do
so, run the following commands:

....
yum install epel-release
yum install clamav clamav-scanner clamav-scanner-systemd clamav-server
clamav-server-systemd clamav-update
....

NOTE: Regardless of your operating system, we recommend that you enable verbose logging in both `clamd.conf` and `freshclam.conf` until you get any kinks with your ClamAV installation worked out.

[[configuring-and-running-clamav]]
== Configuring and Running ClamAV

After installing ClamAV and the related tools, you will now have two
configuration files: `/etc/freshclam.conf` and `/etc/clamd.d/scan.conf`.
You must edit both of these before you can run ClamAV. Both files are
well commented. Running either `man clamd.conf` or `man freshclam.conf`
will provide detailed information on all the available configuration
options.

NOTE: Refer to `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` when you need to verify the ClamAV user and group.

When you’re finished editing the configuration files, you must enable
the `clamd` service file and start `clamd`. You can do so using the
following commands:

....
systemctl enable clamav-daemon.service
systemctl start clamav-daemon.service
....

That should take care of everything.

NOTE: Enable verbose logging in `scan.conf` and `freshclam.conf` until it is running the way you want.

[[automating-clamav-virus-database-updates]]
== Automating ClamAV Virus Database Updates

To update your malware database and get the latest malware signatures,
you need to run `freshclam` frequently. Do this by running `freshclam`
or `sudo freshclam` on Debian-based distributions.

We recommend you do this, post-installation, to download your first set
of malware signatures. If you want to adjust freshclam’s behavior, edit
`/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf` and make any changes you believe are
necessary.

After that, create a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron job] to
automate the process. For example, to run it every hour at 47 minutes
past the hour, add the following in the applicable user’s crontab:

....
# m   h  dom mon dow  command
47  *  *   *    *  /usr/bin/freshclam --quiet
....

NOTE: Please avoid any multiples of 10, because those are when the ClamAV servers are hit the hardest for updates.

[[install-the-anti-virus-app]]
Install the Anti-Virus App
--------------------------

The Anti-Virus app needs to be installed from the ownCloud Market, under
_"Security"_. You can access the ownCloud Market via the App Menu (or
App Switcher).

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/antivirus-app.png[image]

[[configuring-clamav-within-owncloud]]
== Configuring ClamAV within ownCloud

Once it is installed, go to your ownCloud Admin page and set your
ownCloud logging level to `Everything`.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/antivirus-logging.png[image]

Now, navigate to `Settings -> Admin -> Security`, where you’ll find the
``**Antivirus Configuration**'' panel. There, as below, you’ll see the
configuration options which ownCloud will pass to ClamAV.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/antivirus-config.png[image]

[[configuration-warnings]]
=== Configuration Warnings

The Antivirus App for Files will show one of three warnings if it is
either misconfigured, or ClamAV is not available. You can see an example
of all three below.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/server/anti-virus-message-host-connection-problem.png[image]

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/server/anti-virus-message-misconfiguration-problem.png[image]

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/server/anti-virus-message-socket-connection-problem.png[image]

[[mode-configuration]]
=== Mode Configuration

ClamAV runs in one of three modes: link:[Daemon (Socket)],
link:[Daemon], and link:[Executable].

[[daemon-socket]]
Daemon (Socket)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this mode, ClamAV runs in the background on the same server as the
ownCloud installation. When there is no activity `clamd` places a
minimal load on your system. However, if your users upload large volumes
of files, you will see high CPU usage. Please keep this in mind.

ownCloud should detect your `clamd` socket and fill in the `Socket`
field. This is the `LocalSocket` option in `clamd.conf`. You can run
`netstat` to verify:

....
netstat -a|grep clam
unix 2 [ ACC ] STREAM LISTENING 15857 /var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl
....

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/antivirus-daemon-socket.png[image]

The `Stream Length` value sets the number of bytes to read in one pass.
10485760 bytes, or ten megabytes, is the default. This value should be
no larger than the PHP `memory_limit` settings or physical memory if
`memory_limit` is set to -1 (no limit).

`Action for infected files found while scanning` gives you the choice of
logging any alerts without deleting the files or immediately deleting
infected files.

[[daemon]]
=== Daemon

In this mode, ClamAV runs on a different server. This is a good option
for ownCloud servers with high volumes of file uploads. For the Daemon
option, you need the hostname or IP address of the remote server running
ClamAV and the server’s port number.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/antivirus-daemon-socket.png[image]

[[executable]]
=== Executable

In this mode, ClamAV runs on the same server as the ownCloud
installation, and the `clamscan` command only runs when a file is
uploaded. `clamscan` is slow and not always reliable for on-demand
usage; it is better to use one of the daemon modes.

This option requires the path to `clamscan`, which is the interactive
ClamAV scanning command. ownCloud should find it automatically.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/antivirus-executable.png[image]

When you are satisfied with how ClamAV is operating, you might want to
go back and change all of your logging to less verbose levels.

[[rule-configuration]]
=== Rule Configuration

ownCloud provides the ability to customize how it reacts to the response
given by an anti-virus scan. To do so, under
Admin -> Antivirus Configuration -> Advanced, which you can see in the
screenshot below, you can view and change the existing rules. You can
also add new ones.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/server/anti-virus-configuration-rules.png[image]

Rules can match on either an exit status (e.g., 0, 1, or 40) or a
pattern in the string returned from ClamAV (e.g., `/.*: (.*) FOUND$/`).

Here are some points to bear in mind about rules:

* Scanner exit status rules are used to handle errors when ClamAV is run
in CLI mode while
* scanner output rules are used in daemon/socket mode.
* Daemon output is parsed by regexp.
* In case there are no matching rules, the status is: `Unknown`, and a
warning will be logged.

[[default-ruleset]]
=== Default Ruleset

The default rule set for ClamAV is populated automatically with the
following rules:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Exit Status or Signature |Description |Marks File As
|0 | |Clean

|1 | |Infected

|40 |Unknown option passed |Unchecked

|50 |Database initialization error |Unchecked

|52 |Not supported file type |Unchecked

|53 |Can’t open directory |Unchecked

|54 |Can’t open file |Unchecked

|55 |Error reading file |Unchecked

|56 |Can’t stat input file |Unchecked

|57 |Can’t get absolute path name of current working directory
|Unchecked

|58 |I/O error |Unchecked

|62 |Can’t initialize logger |Unchecked

|63 |Can’t create temporary files/directories |Unchecked

|64 |Can’t write to temporary directory |Unchecked

|70 |Can’t allocate memory (calloc) |Unchecked

|71 |Can’t allocate memory (malloc) |Unchecked

|`/.*: OK$/` | |Clean

|`/.*: (.*) FOUND$/` | |Infected

|`/.*: (.*) ERROR$/` | |Unchecked
|=======================================================================

The rules are always checked in the following order:

1.  Infected
2.  Error
3.  Clean

In case there are no matching rules, the status would be `Unknown` and a
warning would be logged.

[[update-an-existing-rule]]
Update An Existing Rule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To match on an exit status, change the ``**Match by**'' dropdown list to
``**Scanner exit status**'' and in the ``**Scanner exit status or
signature to search**'' field, add the status code to match on.

To match on the scanner’s output, change the ``**Match by**'' dropdown
list to ``**Scanner output**'' and in the ``**Scanner exit status or
signature to search**'' field, add the regular expression to match
against the scanner’s output.

Then, while not mandatory, add a description of what the status or scan
output means. After that, set what ownCloud should do when the exit
status or regular expression you set matches the value returned by
ClamAV. To do so change the value of the dropdown in the ``**Mark as**''
column.

The dropdown supports the following three options:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=================================================
|Option |Description
|Clean |The file is clean, and contains no viruses
|Infected |The file contains a virus
|Unchecked |No action should be taken
|=================================================

With all these changes made, click the check mark on the lefthand side
of the ``**Match by**'' column, to confirm the change to the rule.

[[add-a-new-rule]]
Add A New Rule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new rule, click the button marked ``Add a rule'' at the bottom
left of the rules table. Then follow the process outlined in
xref:default-ruleset[Update An Existing Rule].

[[delete-an-existing-rule]]
Delete An Existing Rule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To delete an existing rule, click the rubbish bin icon on the far
right-hand side of the rule that you want to delete.
