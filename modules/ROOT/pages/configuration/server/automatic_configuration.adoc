Automatic Configuration Setup
=============================

If you need to install ownCloud on multiple servers, you normally do not
want to set up each instance separately as described in
../../configuration/database/linux_database_configuration. For this
reason, ownCloud provides an automatic configuration feature.

To take advantage of this feature, you must create a configuration file,
called ../owncloud/config/autoconfig.php, and set the file parameters as
required. You can specify any number of parameters in this file. Any
unspecified parameters appear on the ``Finish setup'' screen when you
first launch ownCloud.

The ../owncloud/config/autoconfig.php is automatically removed after the
initial configuration has been applied.

[[parameters]]
Parameters
----------

When configuring parameters, you must understand that two parameters are
named differently in this configuration file when compared to the
standard config.php file.

Automatic Configurations Examples
---------------------------------

The following sections provide sample automatic configuration examples
and what information is requested at the end of the configuration.

[[data-directory]]
Data Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the following parameter settings, the ``Finish setup'' screen
requests database and admin credentials settings.

....
<?php
$AUTOCONFIG = array(
  "directory"     => "/www/htdocs/owncloud/data",
);
....

[[sqlite-database]]
SQLite Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the following parameter settings, the ``Finish setup'' screen
requests data directory and admin credentials settings.

....
<?php
$AUTOCONFIG = array(
  "dbtype"        => "sqlite",
  "dbname"        => "owncloud",
  "dbtableprefix" => "",
);
....

[[mysql-database]]
MySQL Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the following parameter settings, the ``Finish setup'' screen
requests data directory and admin credentials settings.

....
<?php
$AUTOCONFIG = array(
  "dbtype"        => "mysql",
  "dbname"        => "owncloud",
  "dbuser"        => "username",
  "dbpass"        => "password",
  "dbhost"        => "localhost",
  "dbtableprefix" => "",
);
....

Keep in mind that the automatic configuration does not eliminate the
need for creating the database user and database in advance, as
described in ../../configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.

[[postgresql-database]]
PostgreSQL Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the following parameter settings, the ``Finish setup'' screen
requests data directory and admin credentials settings.

....
<?php
$AUTOCONFIG = array(
  "dbtype"        => "pgsql",
  "dbname"        => "owncloud",
  "dbuser"        => "username",
  "dbpass"        => "password",
  "dbhost"        => "localhost",
  "dbtableprefix" => "",
);
....

Keep in mind that the automatic configuration does not eliminate the
need for creating the database user and database in advance, as
described in ../../configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.

[[all-parameters]]
All Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the following parameter settings, because all parameters are
already configured in the file, the ownCloud installation skips the
``Finish setup'' screen.

....
<?php
$AUTOCONFIG = array(
  "dbtype"        => "mysql",
  "dbname"        => "owncloud",
  "dbuser"        => "username",
  "dbpass"        => "password",
  "dbhost"        => "localhost",
  "dbtableprefix" => "",
  "adminlogin"    => "root",
  "adminpass"     => "root-password",
  "directory"     => "/www/htdocs/owncloud/data",
);
....

Keep in mind that the automatic configuration does not eliminate the
need for creating the database user and database in advance, as
described in ../../configuration/database/linux_database_configuration.
