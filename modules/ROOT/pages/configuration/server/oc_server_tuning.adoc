ownCloud Server Tuning
======================

[[using-cron-to-perform-background-jobs]]
Using Cron to Perform Background Jobs
-------------------------------------

See background_jobs_configuration for a description and the benefits.

[[enable-memory-caching]]
Enable Memory Caching
---------------------

Caching improves performance by storing data, code, and other objects in
memory. Memory cache configuration for ownCloud is no longer
automatically available from ownCloud 8.1 but must be installed and
configured separately. ownCloud supports https://redis.io[Redis],
http://php.net/manual/en/intro.apcu.php[APCu], and
https://memcached.org[Memcached] as memory caching backends. See
caching_configuration, for further details.

[[use-redis-based-transactional-file-locking]]
Use Redis-based Transactional File Locking
------------------------------------------

File locking is enabled by default, using the database locking backend.
However, this places a significant load on your database. See the
section ../../configuration/files/files_locking_transactional for how to
configure ownCloud to use Redis-based Transactional File Locking.

[[redis-tuning]]
Redis Tuning
------------

Redis tuning improves both file locking (if used) and memory caching
(when using Redis). Here is a brief guide for tuning Redis to improve
the performance of your ownCloud installation, when working with
sizeable instances.

[[tcp-backlog]]
TCP-Backlog
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you raised the TCP-backlog setting, the following warning appears in
the Redis logs:

[source,console]
----
WARNING: The TCP backlog setting of 20480 cannot be enforced because /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn is set to the lower value of..
----

If so, please consider that newer versions of Redis have their own
TCP-backlog value set to `511`, and that you have to increase if you
have many connections. In high requests-per-second environments, you
need a significant backlog to avoid slow clients connection issues.

The Linux kernel will silently truncate the TCP-backlog setting to the
value of `/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn`. So make sure to raise both the
value of `somaxconn` and `tcp_max_syn_backlog`, to get the desired
effect.

To fix this warning, set the value of `net.core.somaxconn` to `65535` in
`/etc/rc.local`, so that it persists upon reboot, by running the
following command.

[source,console]
----
sudo echo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=65535 >> /etc/rc.local
----

After the next reboot, 65535 connections will be allowed, instead of the
default value.

[[transparent-huge-pages-thp]]
Transparent Huge Pages (THP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are experiencing latency problems with Redis, the following
warning may appear in your Redis logs:

[source,console]
----
WARNING you have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) support enabled in your kernel. This creates both latency and memory usage issues with Redis.
----

If so, unfortunately, when a Linux kernel has
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/transhuge.txt[Transparent
Huge Pages] enabled, Redis incurs a significant latency penalty after
the fork call is used, to persist information to disk. Transparent Huge
Pages are the cause of the following issue:

1.  A fork call is made, resulting in two processes with shared huge
pages being created.
2.  In a busy instance, a few event loops cause commands to target a few
thousand pages, causing the copy-on-write of almost the entire process
memory.
3.  Big latency and memory usage result.

As a result, make sure to disable Transparent Huge Pages using the
following command:

[source,console]
----
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
----

[[redis-latency-problems]]
Redis Latency Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are having issues with Redis latency, please refer to
https://redis.io/topics/latency[the official Redis guide] on how to
handle them.

[[database-tuning]]
Database Tuning
---------------

[[using-mariadbmysql-instead-of-sqlite]]
Using MariaDB/MySQL Instead of SQLite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MySQL or MariaDB are preferred because of the
http://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html[performance limitations of SQLite
with highly concurrent applications], like ownCloud.

See the section
../../configuration/database/linux_database_configuration for how to
configure ownCloud for MySQL or MariaDB. If your installation is already
running on SQLite then it is possible to convert to MySQL or MariaDB
using the steps provided in ../../configuration/database/db_conversion.

[[tune-mariadbmysql]]
Tune MariaDB/MySQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A comprehensive guide to tuning MySQL and MariaDB is outside the scope
of the ownCloud documentation. However, here are three links that can
help you find further information:

* https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl/[MySQLTuner].
* https://tools.percona.com/wizard[Percona Tools for MySQL]
* https://mariadb.com/kb/en/optimization-and-tuning/[Optimizing and
Tuning MariaDB].

[[tune-postgresql]]
Tune PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A comprehensive guide to tuning PostgreSQL is outside the scope of the
ownCloud documentation. However, here are three links that can help you
find further information:

* http://de.slideshare.net/PGExperts/five-steps-perform2013[Five Steps
to PostgreSQL Performance]
* http://grokbase.com/t/postgresql/pgsql-admin/103qcpdrpf/tuning-auto-vacuum-for-highly-active-tables#20100323hfs3jtjuaywwufukoqtexkpjti[Tuning
the autovacuum proceff for tables with huge update workloads
(oc_filecache)]

[[ssl-encryption-app]]
SSL / Encryption App
--------------------

SSL (HTTPS) and file encryption/decryption can be offloaded to a
processorâ€™s AES-NI extension. This can both speed up these operations
while lowering processing overhead. This requires a processor with the
http://wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set[AES-NI instruction set].

Here are some examples how to check if your CPU / environment supports
the AES-NI extension:

* For each CPU core present: `grep flags /proc/cpuinfo` or as a summary
for all cores: `grep -m 1 ^flags /proc/cpuinfo` If the result contains
any `aes`, the extension is present.
* Search eg. on the Intel web if the processor used supports the
extension http://ark.intel.com/MySearch.aspx?AESTech=true[Intel
Processor Feature Filter] You may set a filter by
`"AES New Instructions"` to get a reduced result set.
* For versions of openssl >= 1.0.1, AES-NI does not work via an engine
and will not show up in the `openssl engine` command. It is active by
default on the supported hardware. You can check the openssl version via
`openssl  version -a`
* If your processor supports AES-NI but it does not show up eg via grep
or coreinfo, it is maybe disabled in the BIOS.
* If your environment runs virtualized, check the virtualization vendor
for support.

[[webserver-tuning]]
Webserver Tuning
----------------

[[tune-apache]]
Tune Apache
~~~~~~~~~~~

[[enable-http2-support]]
Enable HTTP/2 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to improve the speed of an ownCloud installation, while at
the same time increasing its security, you can
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/http2.html[enable HTTP/2 support
for Apache]. Please be aware that https://caniuse.com/#feat=http2[most
browsers require HTTP/2 to be used with SSL enabled].

[[apache-processes]]
Apache Processes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An Apache process uses around 12MB of RAM. Apache should be configured
so that the maximum number of HTTPD processes times 12MB is lower than
the amount of RAM. Otherwise the system begins to swap and the
performance goes down.

[[use-keepalive]]
Use KeepAlive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection[KeepAlive]
directive enables persistent HTTP connections, allowing multiple
requests to be sent over the same TCP connection. Enabling it reduces
latency by as much as 50%. In combination with the periodic checks of
the sync client the following settings are recommended:

....
KeepAlive On
KeepAliveTimeout 100
MaxKeepAliveRequests 200
....

[[hostname-lookups]]
Hostname Lookups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

....
# cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    ...
HostnameLookups off
....

[[log-files]]
Log files
^^^^^^^^^

Log files should be switched off for maximum performance. To do that,
comment out the
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog[CustomLog]
directive. However, keep
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html#errorlog[ErrorLog] set, so
errors can be tracked down.
