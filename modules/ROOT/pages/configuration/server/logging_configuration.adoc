Logging Configuration
=====================

Use your ownCloud log to review system status, or to help debug
problems. You may adjust logging levels, and choose between using the
ownCloud log or your syslog.

[[parameters]]
Parameters
----------

Logging levels range from *DEBUG*, which logs all activity, to *FATAL*,
which logs only fatal errors.

* *0*: DEBUG: Debug, informational, warning, and error messages, and
fatal issues.
* *1*: INFO: Informational, warning, and error messages, and fatal
issues.
* *2*: WARN: Warning, and error messages, and fatal issues.
* *3*: ERROR: Error messages and fatal issues.
* *4*: FATAL: Fatal issues only.

By default the log level is set to *2* (WARN). Use *DEBUG* when you have
a problem to diagnose, and then reset your log level to a less-verbose
level, as *DEBUG* outputs a lot of information, and can affect your
server performance.

Logging level parameters are set in the config/config.php file, or on
the Admin page of your ownCloud Web GUI.

[[owncloud]]
ownCloud
~~~~~~~~

All log information will be written to a separate log file which can be
viewed using the log viewer on your Admin page. By default, a log file
named *owncloud.log* will be created in the directory which has been
configured by the *datadirectory* parameter in config/config.php.

The desired date format can optionally be defined using the
*logdateformat* parameter in config/config.php. By default the
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php[PHP date function]
parameter ``__c__'' is used, and therefore the date/time is written in
the format ``__2013-01-10T15:20:25+02:00__''. By using the date format
in the example below, the date/time format will be written in the format
``__January 10, 2013 15:20:25__''.

....
"log_type" => "owncloud",
"logfile" => "owncloud.log",
"loglevel" => "3",
"logdateformat" => "F d, Y H:i:s",
....

[[syslog]]
syslog
~~~~~~

All log information will be sent to your default syslog daemon.

....
"log_type" => "syslog",
"logfile" => "",
"loglevel" => "3",
....

The syslog format can be changed to remove or add information. In
addition to the `%replacements%` below `%level%` can be used, but it is
used as a dedicated parameter to the syslog logging facility anyway.

....
'log.syslog.format' => '[%reqId%][%remoteAddr%][%user%][%app%][%method%][%url%] %message%',

   For the old syslog message format use:

'log.syslog.format' => '{%app%} %message%', 
....

[[conditional-logging-level-increase]]
Conditional Logging Level Increase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the logging level to automatically increase to `debug`
when the first condition inside a condition block is met. All conditions
are optional !

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
* `shared_secret`: A unique token. If a http(s) request parameter named
`log_secret` is added::
  to the request and set to this token, the condition is met.
* `users`: If the current request is done by one of the specified
users,::
  this condition is met.
* `apps`: If the log message is invoked by one of the specified apps,::
  this condition is met.
* `logfile`: The log message invoked gets redirected to this logfile::
  when a condition above is met.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

Notes regarding the logfile key:

1.  If no logfile is defined, the standard logfile is used.
2.  Not applicable when using syslog.

[verse]
--
The following example demonstrates how all three conditions can look like.
The first one that matches triggers the condition block writing the log entry to the defined logfile.
--

....
'log.condition' => [
   'shared_secret' => '57b58edb6637fe3059b3595cf9c41b9',
   'users' => ['user1', 'user2'],
   'apps' => ['gallery'],
   'logfile' => '/tmp/test2.log'
],
....

Based on the conditional log settings above, following logs are written
to the same logfile defined:

* Requests matching `log_secret` are debug logged.

....
curl -X PROPFIND -u sample-user:password \
  https://your_domain/remote.php/webdav/?log_secret=57b58edb6637fe3059b3595cf9c41b9
....

* `user1` and `user2` gets debug logged.
* Access to app `gallery` gets debug logged.
