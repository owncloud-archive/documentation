Knowledge Base Configuration
============================

The usage of ownCloud is more or less self explaining but nevertheless a
user might run into a problem where he needs to consult the
documentation or knowledge base. To ease access to the ownCloud
documentation and knowledge base, a help menu item is shown in the
settings menu by default.

requests you have to answer in the future
