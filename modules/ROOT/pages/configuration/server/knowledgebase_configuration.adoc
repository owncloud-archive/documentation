= Knowledge Base Configuration

The usage of ownCloud is more or less self explaining but nevertheless a
user might run into a problem where he needs to consult the
documentation or knowledge base. To ease access to the ownCloud
documentation and knowledge base, a help menu item is shown in the
settings menu by default.

[[parameters]]
== Parameters

If you want to disable the ownCloud help menu item you can use the
*knowledgebaseenabled* parameter inside the config/config.php.

....
<?php

  "knowledgebaseenabled" => true,
....

NOTE: Disabling the help menu item might increase the number of support requests you have to answer in the future.
