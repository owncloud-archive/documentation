Background Jobs
===============

A system like ownCloud sometimes requires tasks to be done on a regular
basis without requiring user interaction or hindering ownCloud’s
performance. For that reason, as a system administrator, you can
configure background jobs (for example, database clean-ups) to be
executed without any user interaction.

These jobs are typically referred to as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[Cron Jobs]. Cron jobs are commands or
shell-based scripts that are scheduled to periodically run at fixed
times, dates, or intervals. `cron.php` is an ownCloud internal process
that runs such background jobs on demand.

ownCloud plug-in applications can register actions with `cron.php`
automatically to take care of typical housekeeping operations. These
actions can include garbage collecting of temporary files or checking
for newly updated files using `filescan()` on externally mounted file
systems.

You can decide how often jobs get processed, we recommend an interval of
one minute.

Cron Jobs
---------

You can schedule Cron jobs in three ways: link:[Cron], link:[Webcron],
or link:[AJAX]. These can all be configured in the admin settings menu.
However, the recommended method is to use Cron. The following sections
describe the differences between each method.

There are a number of things to keep in mind when choosing an automation
option:

Firstly, while the default method is AJAX, though the preferred way is
to use Cron. The reason for this distinction is that AJAX is easier to
get up and running. As a result, it makes sense (often times) to accept
it in the interests of expediency.

However, doing so is known to cause issues, such as backlogs and
potentially not running every job on a heavily-loaded system. What’s
more, an increasing amount of ownCloud automation has been migrated from
Ajax to Cron in recent versions. For this reason, we encourage you to
not use it for too long — especially if your site is rapidly growing.

Secondly, while Webcron is better than Ajax, it too has limitations. For
example, running Webcron will only remove a single item from the job
queue, not all of them. Cron, however, will clear the entire queue.

It’s for this reason that we encourage you to use Cron — if at all
possible.

Using the operating system Cron feature is the preferred method for
executing regular tasks. This method enables the execution of scheduled
jobs without the inherent limitations which the web server might have.

For example, to run a Cron job on a *nix system every minute, under the
default web server user (often, `www-data` or `wwwrun`) you must set up
the following Cron job to call the *cron.php* script:

....
# crontab -u www-data -e
*  *  *  *  * /usr/bin/php -f /path/to/your/owncloud/cron.php
....

You can verify if the cron job has been added and scheduled by
executing:

....
# crontab -u www-data -l
*  *  *  *  * /usr/bin/php -f /path/to/your/owncloud/cron.php
....

You have to make sure that `php` is found by `cron`, hence why we’ve
deliberately added the full path to the PHP binary above
(`/usr/bin/php`). On some systems it might be necessary to use *php-cli*
instead of *php*.

Please refer to https://linux.die.net/man/1/crontab[the crontab man
page] for the exact command syntax if you don’t want to have it run
every minute.

[[webcron]]
Webcron
~~~~~~~

By registering your ownCloud `cron.php` script address as an external
webcron service (for example, http://www.easycron.com/[easyCron]), you
ensure that background jobs are executed regularly. To use this type of
service, your external webcron service must be able to access your
ownCloud server using the Internet. For example:

....
URL to call: http[s]://<domain-of-your-server>/owncloud/cron.php
....

[[ajax]]
AJAX
~~~~

The AJAX scheduling method is the default option. However, it is also
the _least_ reliable. Each time a user visits the ownCloud page, a
single background job is executed. The advantage of this mechanism,
however, is that it does not require access to the system nor
registration with a third party service. The disadvantage of this
mechanism, when compared to the link:[Webcron] service, is that it
requires regular visits to the page for it to be triggered.

Especially when using the Activity App or external storages, where new
files are added, updated, or deleted one of the other methods should be
used.

[[parallel-task-execution]]
Parallel Task Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regardless of the approach which you take, since ownCloud 9.1, Cron jobs
can be run in parallel. This is done by running `cron.php` multiple
times. Depending on the process which you’re automating, this may not be
necessary. However, for longer-running tasks, such as those which are
LDAP related, it may be very beneficial.

There is no way to do so via the ownCloud UI. But, the most direct way
to do so, is by opening three console tabs and in each one run
`php cron.php`. Each of these processes would acquire their own list of
jobs to process without overlapping any other.

[[available-background-jobs]]
Available Background Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number of existing background jobs are available to be run just for
specific tasks.

These jobs are generally only needed on large instances and can be run
as background jobs. If the number of users in your installation ranges
between 1,000 and 3,000, or if you’re using LDAP and it becomes a
bottleneck, then admins can delete several entries in the oc_jobs table
and replace them with the corresponding occ command, which you can see
here:

* `OCA\\DAV\\Command\\CleanupChunks` -> `occ dav:cleanup-chunks`
* `OCA\\DAV\CardDAV\\SyncJob` -> `occ dav:sync-system-addressbook`
* `OCA\\Federation\\SyncJob` -> `occ federation:sync-addressbooks`
* `OCA\\Files_Trashbin\\BackgroundJob\\ExpireTrash` ->
`occ trashbin:expire`
* `OCA\\Files_Versions\\BackgroundJob\\ExpireVersions` ->
`occ versions:expire`

If used, these should be scheduled to run on a daily basis.

While not exhaustive, these include:

[[cleanupchunks]]
CleanupChunks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CleanupChunks job, contained in `OCA\\DAV\\Command\\CleanupChunks`,
will clean up outdated chunks (uploaded files) more than a certain
number of days old. By default, the command cleans up chunks more than
two days old. However, the command also accepts the number of days as an
argument. It can be run, as follows, using the OCC command

....
occ dav:cleanup-chunks
....

[[expiretrash]]
ExpireTrash
^^^^^^^^^^^

The ExpireTrash job, contained in
`OCA\Files_Trashbin\BackgroundJob\ExpireTrash`, will remove any file in
the ownCloud trash bin which is older than the specified maximum file
retention time. It can be run, as follows, using the OCC command:

....
occ trashbin:expire
....

[[expireversions]]
ExpireVersions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ExpireVersions job, contained in
`OCA\Files_Versions\BackgroundJob\ExpireVersions`, will expire versions
of files which are older than the specified maximum version retention
time. It can be run, as follows, using the OCC command:

....
occ versions:expire
....

Please take care when adding `ExpireTrash` and `ExpireVersions` as
link:[Cron] jobs. Make sure that they’re not started in parallel on
multiple machines. Running in parallel on a single machine is fine. But,
currently, there isn’t sufficient locking in place to prevent them from
conflicting with each other if running in parallel across multiple
machines.

[[syncjob-carddav]]
SyncJob (CardDAV)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CardDAV SyncJob, contained in `OCA\DAV\CardDAV\SyncJob`, syncs the
local system address book, updating any existing contacts, and deleting
any expired contacts. It can be run, as follows, using the OCC command:

....
occ dav:sync-system-addressbook
....

[[syncjob-federation]]
SyncJob (Federation)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OCAFederationSyncJob

It can be run, as follows, using the OCC command:

....
occ federation:sync-addressbooks
....
