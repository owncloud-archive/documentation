ownCloud Enterprise users have the option of enabling
https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/password_policy[the Password
Policy app]. This application enables administrators to define password
requirements, including: _minimum characters_, _numbers_, _capital
letters_, and more, for all kinds of password endpoints, such as for
user passwords and public link sharing passwords. Moreover the admin can
enforce expiration dates for public link shares.

ownCloud Community Edition users, however, can use
https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/security[the Security app],
available from the ownCloud Marketplace. It supports configuring a basic
password policy, which includes:

1.  Setting a password length
2.  Whether to enforce at least one upper and lower case character, a
numerical character and a special character.
