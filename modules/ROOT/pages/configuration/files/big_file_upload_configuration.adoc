Uploading big files > 512MB
===========================

The default maximum file size for uploads, in ownCloud, is 512MB. You
can increase this limit up to the maximum file size which your
filesystem, operating system, or other software allows, for example:

* < 2GB on a 32Bit OS-architecture
* < 2GB with IE6 - IE8
* < 4GB with IE9 - IE11

64-bit filesystems have much higher limits. Please consult the
documentation for your filesystem.

The ownCloud sync client itself however is able to upload files of any
size, as it uploads files by transmitting them in small chunks. But, it
can never exceed the maximum file size limits of the remote host.

[[system-configuration]]
System Configuration
--------------------

* Make sure that the latest version of PHP (at least 5.6) is installed
* Disable user quotas, which makes them unlimited
* Your temp file or partition has to be big enough to hold multiple
parallel uploads from multiple users; e.g. if the max upload size is
10GB and the average number of users uploading at the same time is 100:
temp space has to hold at least 10x100 GB

[[configuring-your-web-server]]
Configuring Your Web server
---------------------------

ownCloud comes with its own `owncloud/.htaccess` file. Because `php-fpm`
can’t read PHP settings in `.htaccess` these settings must be set in the
`owncloud/.user.ini` file.

Set the following two parameters inside the corresponding php.ini file
(see the *Loaded Configuration File* section of label-phpinfo to find
your relevant php.ini files) :

....
php_value upload_max_filesize = 16G
php_value post_max_size = 16G
....

Adjust these values for your needs. If you see PHP timeouts in your
logfiles, increase the timeout values, which are in seconds:

....
php_value max_input_time 3600
php_value max_execution_time 3600
....

The
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_reqtimeout.html[mod_reqtimeout]
Apache module could also stop large uploads from completing. If you’re
using this module and getting failed uploads of large files either
disable it in your Apache config or raise the configured
`RequestReadTimeout` timeouts.

There are also several other configuration options in your Web server
config which could prevent the upload of larger files. Please see the
manual of your Web server for how to configure those values correctly:

[[apache]]
Apache
~~~~~~

* https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody[LimitRequestBody]
* https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslrenegbuffersize[SSLRenegBufferSize]

[[apache-with-mod_fcgid]]
Apache with mod_fcgid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* https://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html#fcgidmaxrequestinmem[FcgidMaxRequestInMem]
* https://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html#fcgidmaxrequestlen[FcgidMaxRequestLen]

If you are using Apache/2.4 with mod_fcgid, as of February/March 2016,
`FcgidMaxRequestInMem` still needs to be significantly increased from
its default value to avoid the occurence of segmentation faults when
uploading big files. This is not a regular setting but serves as a
workaround for
https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51747[Apache with
mod_fcgid bug #51747].

Setting `FcgidMaxRequestInMem` significantly higher than normal may no
longer be necessary, once bug #51747 is fixed.

[[nginx]]
NGINX
~~~~~

* http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size[client_max_body_size]
* http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_read_timeout[fastcgi_read_timeout]
* http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_body_temp_path[client_body_temp_path]

Since NGINX 1.7.11 a new config option
https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_request_buffering[fastcgi_request_buffering]
is availabe. Setting this option to `fastcgi_request_buffering off;` in
your NGINX config might help with timeouts during the upload.
Furthermore it helps if you’re running out of disc space on the `/tmp`
partition of your system.

For more info how to configure NGINX to raise the upload limits see also
https://github.com/owncloud/documentation/wiki/Uploading-files-up-to-16GB#configuring-nginx[this]
wiki entry.

Make sure that `client_body_temp_path` points to a partition with
adequate space for your upload file size, and on the same partition as
the `upload_tmp_dir` or `tempdirectory` (see below). For optimal
performance, place these on a separate hard drive that is dedicated to
swap and temp storage.

If your site is behind a NGINX frontend (for example a loadbalancer):

By default, downloads will be limited to 1GB due to `proxy_buffering`
and `proxy_max_temp_file_size` on the frontend.

* If you can access the frontend’s configuration, disable
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffering[proxy_buffering]
or increase
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_max_temp_file_size[proxy_max_temp_file_size]
from the default 1GB.
* If you do not have access to the frontend, set the
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffering[X-Accel-Buffering]
header to `add_header X-Accel-Buffering no;` on your backend server.

[[configuring-php]]
Configuring PHP
---------------

If you don’t want to use the ownCloud `.htaccess` or `.user.ini` file,
you may configure PHP instead. Make sure to comment out any lines
`.htaccess` pertaining to upload size, if you entered any.

If you are running ownCloud on a 32-bit system, any `open_basedir`
directive in your `php.ini` file needs to be commented out.

Set the following two parameters inside `php.ini`, using your own
desired file size values:

....
upload_max_filesize = 16G
post_max_size = 16G
....

Tell PHP which temp file you want it to use:

....
upload_tmp_dir = /var/big_temp_file/
....

*Output Buffering* must be turned off in `.htaccess` or `.user.ini` or
`php.ini`, or PHP will return memory-related errors:

* `output_buffering = 0`

[[configuring-owncloud]]
Configuring ownCloud
--------------------

As an alternative to the `upload_tmp_dir` of PHP (e.g., if you don’t
have access to your `php.ini`) you can also configure a temporary
location for uploaded files by using the `tempdirectory` setting in your
`config.php` (See
../../configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters).

If you have configured the `session_lifetime` setting in your
`config.php` (See
../../configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters) file then make
sure it is not too low. This setting needs to be configured to at least
the time (in seconds) that the longest upload will take. If unsure
remove this completely from your configuration to reset it to the
default shown in the `config.sample.php`.

[[configuring-upload-limits-within-the-gui]]
Configuring upload limits within the GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If all prerequisites described in this documentation are in place an
admin can change the upload limits on demand by using the
`File handling` input box within the administrative backend of ownCloud.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/files/admin_filehandling-1.png[image]

Depending on your environment you might get an insufficient permissions
message shown for this input box.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/files/admin_filehandling-2.png[image]

To be able to use this input box you need to make sure that:

* Your Web server is be able to use the `.htaccess` file shipped by
ownCloud (Apache only)
* The user your Web server is running as has write permissions to the
files `.htaccess` and `.user.ini`

strong_perms_label might prevent write access to these files. As an
admin you need to decide between the ability to use the input box and a
more secure ownCloud installation where you need to manually modify the
upload limits in the `.htaccess` and `.user.ini` files described above.

[[general-upload-issues]]
General upload issues
---------------------

Various environmental factors could cause a restriction of the upload
size. Examples are:

* The `LVE Manager` of `CloudLinux` which sets a `I/O limit`
* Some services like `Cloudflare` are also known to cause uploading
issues
* Upload limits enforced by proxies used by your clients
* Other webserver modules like described in
../../issues/general_troubleshooting
