= Encryption Configuration

The primary purpose of the ownCloud server-side encryption is to protect
users’ files when they’re located on remote storages, such as Dropbox
and Google Drive, and to do it smoothly and seamlessly from within
ownCloud.

From ownCloud 9.0, server-side encryption for local and remote storages
can operate independently of each other. By doing so, you can encrypt a
remote storage _without_ also having to encrypt your home storage on
your ownCloud server.

NOTE: Starting with ownCloud 9.0 we support Authenticated Encryption for all newly encrypted files. See https://hackerone.com/reports/108082 for more technical information about the impact.

For maximum security make sure to configure external storage with
``__Check for changes: Never__.'' This will let ownCloud ignore new
files not added via ownCloud. By doing so, a malicious external storage
administrator cannot add new files to the storage without your
knowledge. However, this is not wise _if_ your external storage is
subject to legitimate external changes.

ownCloud’s server-side encryption encrypts files stored on the ownCloud
server and files on remote storages that are connected to your ownCloud
server. Encryption and decryption are performed on the ownCloud server.
All files sent to remote storage will be encrypted by the ownCloud
server and decrypted before serving them to you or anyone whom you have
shared them with.

NOTE: Encrypting files increases their size by roughly 35%. Remember to take this into account when you are both provisioning storage and setting storage quotas. Secondly, user quotas are based on the _unencrypted_ file size — *not* the encrypted size.

When files on an external storage are encrypted in ownCloud, you cannot
share them directly from the external storage services, only through
ownCloud sharing. This is because the key to decrypt the data *never*
leaves the ownCloud server.

ownCloud’s server-side encryption generates a strong encryption key,
which is unlocked by users’ passwords. As a result, your users don’t
need to track an extra password. All they need to do is log in as they
normally would. ownCloud, transparently, encrypts only the contents of
files, and not filenames and directory structures.

IMPORTANT: You should regularly backup all encryption keys to prevent permanent data loss.

The encryption keys are stored in the following directories:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|======================================================================
|Directory |Description
|`data/<user>/files_encryption` |Users’ private keys and all other keys
| |necessary to decrypt the users’ files.
|`data/files_encryption` |Private keys and all other keys necessary to
| |decrypt the files stored on a system wide
| |external storage.
|======================================================================

NOTE: You can move the keys to a different location. To do so, refer to the link:[Move Key Location] section of the documentation.

When encryption is enabled, all files are encrypted and decrypted by the
ownCloud application, and stored encrypted on your remote storage. This
protects your data on externally hosted storage. The ownCloud admin and
the storage admin will see only encrypted files when browsing backend
storage.

Encryption keys are stored only on the ownCloud server, eliminating
exposure of your data to third-party storage providers. The encryption
application does *not* protect your data if your ownCloud server is
compromised, and it does not prevent ownCloud administrators from
reading users’ files. This would require client-side encryption, which
this application does not provide. If your ownCloud server is not
connected to any external storage services, it is better to use other
encryption tools, such as file-level or whole-disk encryption.

[CAUTION]
====
SSL terminates at or before Apache on the ownCloud server.
Consequently, all files are in an unencrypted state between the SSL connection
termination and the ownCloud code that encrypts and decrypts them.
This is, potentially, exploitable by anyone with administrator access to your server.
For more information, read: https://owncloud.org/blog/how-owncloud-uses-encryption-to-protect-your-data/[How ownCloud uses encryption to protect your data].
====

[[encryption-types]]
== Encryption Types

ownCloud provides two encryption types:

* *Basic encryption:* every user has their own private/public key pairs,
and the private key is protected by the user’s password.
* *Master Key:* there is only one key (or key pair) and all files are
encrypted using that key pair.

IMPORTANT: These encryption types are *not compatible*.

[[before-enabling-encryption]]
== Before Enabling Encryption

Plan very carefully before enabling encryption, because it is not
reversible via the ownCloud Web interface. If you lose your encryption
keys, your files are *not* recoverable. Always have backups of your
encryption keys stored in a safe location, and consider enabling all
recovery options.

You have more options via xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#encryption[the `occ` command’s encryption options].

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can’t manage encryption without access to the command line.
If your ownCloud installation is on a hosted environment and you don’t have access to the command line, you won’t be able to run xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[occ commands].
In this case, *don’t enable encryption*!
====

[[how-to-enable-encryption]]
== How To Enable Encryption

The base encryption system is enabled and disabled on your Admin page.
First, you must enable this, and then select an encryption module to
load. Go to the *Server-side encryption* section of your Admin page and
check *Enable encryption*.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/files/configuration/files/encryption3.png[image]

After clicking *Enable encryption*, you will see the message ``__No
encryption module loaded, please load an encryption module in the app
menu__''. Currently, the only available encryption module is the
ownCloud Default Encryption module. So, go to your Apps page to enable
the ownCloud Default Encryption module.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/files/encryption1.png[image]

Then, return to your Admin page to see that the ownCloud Default
Encryption module has been added to the module selector _and_
automatically selected. Now you *must* log out and then log back in to
initialize your encryption keys.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/files/encryption14.png[image]

When you log back in, a checkbox for enabling encryption on your home
storage, will now be available — checked by default. Uncheck it to avoid
encrypting your home storage.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/files/encryption15.png[image]

[[enabling-encryption-from-the-command-line]]
Enabling Encryption From the Command-line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable encryption via the command-line, involves two commands. These
are:

....
# Enables the default encryption module app
php occ app:enable encryption

# Enables encryption
php occ encryption:enable
....

NOTE: Please note, the commands have to be run in this order.

IMPORTANT: If you already have Basic encryption enabled - you *must not* enable Master Key Based encryption.

[[enabling-master-key-based-encryption]]
== Enabling Master Key Based Encryption

To enable master key based encryption:

1.  Enable the default encryption module app, using the following
command

....
php occ app:enable encryption
....

1.  Then enable encryption, using the following command

....
php occ encryption:enable
....

1.  Then enable the master key, using the following command

....
php occ encryption:select-encryption-type masterkey
....

NOTE: The master key mode has to be set up in a newly created instance.

1.  Encrypt all data

....
php occ encryption:encrypt-all
....

NOTE: This is not typically required, as the master key is often enabled at install time. As a result, when enabling it, there should be no data to encrypt. But, in case it’s being enabled after install, and the installation does have files which are unencrypted, encrypt-all can be used to encrypt them.

[[sharing-encrypted-files]]
== Sharing Encrypted Files

After encryption is enabled, your users must also log out and log back
in to generate their personal encryption keys. They will see a yellow
warning banner that says ``__Encryption App is enabled, but your keys
are not initialized. Please log-out and log-in again.__''

Also, share owners may need to re-share files after encryption is
enabled. Users who are trying to access the share will see a message
advising them to ask the share owner to re-share the file with them.

For individual shares, un-share and re-share the file. For group shares,
share with any individuals who can’t access the share. This updates the
encryption, and then the share owner can remove the individual shares.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/files/encryption9.png[image]

[[encrypting-external-mountpoints]]
== Encrypting External Mountpoints

You and your users can encrypt individual external mount points.
You must have external storage enabled on your Admin page, and enabled for your users.
Encryption settings can be configured in the mount options for xref:configuration/files/external_storage_configuration_gui.adoc[an external storage mount].

[[how-to-enable-users-file-recovery-keys]]
== How To Enable Users File Recovery Keys

Once a user has encrypted their files, if they lose their ownCloud
password, then they lose access to their encrypted files, as their files
will be unrecoverable. It is not possible, when user files are
encrypted, to reset a user’s password using the standard reset process.

If so, you’ll see a yellow banner warning:

_________________________________________________________________________________
Please provide an admin recovery password; otherwise, all user data will
be lost.
_________________________________________________________________________________

To avoid all this, create a Recovery Key. To do so, go to the Encryption
section of your Admin page and set a recovery key password.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/files/encryption10.png[image]

You then need to ask your users to opt-in to the Recovery Key. For the
users to do this, they need to go to the ``**Personal**'' page and
enable the recovery key. This signals that they are OK that the admin
might have a way to decrypt their data for recovery reasons. If they do
_not_ do this, then the Recovery Key won’t work for them.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/files/encryption7.png[image]

For users who have enabled password recovery, give them a new password
and recover access to their encrypted files, by supplying the Recovery
Key on the Users page.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/files/encryption8.png[image]

You may change your recovery key password.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/configuration/files/encryption12.png[image]

NOTE: Sharing a recovery key with a user group is *not* supported. This is only supported with xref:create-a-new-master-key[the master key].

[[changing-the-recovery-key-password]]
== Changing The Recovery Key Password

If you have misplaced your recovery key password and need to replace it,
here’s what you need to do:

1.  Delete the recovery key from both `data/owncloud_private_keys` and
`data/public-keys`
2.  Edit your database table `oc_appconfig` and remove the rows with the
config keys `recoveryKeyId` and `recoveryAdminEnabled` for the appid
`files_encryption`
3.  Login as admin and activate the recovery key again with a new
password. This will generate a new key pair
4.  All users who used the original recovery key will need to disable it
and enable it again. This deletes the old recovery share keys from their
files and encrypts their files with the new recovery key

NOTE: You can only change the recovery key password if you know the original. This is by design, as only admins who know the recovery key password should be able to change it. If not, admins could hijack the recovery key from each other

IMPORTANT: Replacing the recovery key will mean that all users will lose the possibility to recover their files until they have applied the new recovery key.

[[disabling-encryption]]
== Disabling Encryption

To disable encryption, put your ownCloud server into single-user mode,
and then disable your encryption module with these commands:

....
occ maintenance:singleuser --on
occ encryption:disable
....

Take it out of single-user mode when you are finished, by using the
following command:

....
occ maintenance:singleuser --off
....

CAUTION: You may only disable encryption with by using the link:[occ Encryption Commands]. Make sure you have backups of all encryption keys, including those for all your users.

[[not-all-files-are-encrypted]]
== Not All Files Are Encrypted

Only the data in the files in `data/user/files` are encrypted, not the
filenames or folder structures.

In addition, these files are never encrypted:

* Existing files in the trash bin & Versions. Only new and changed files
after encryption is enabled are encrypted.
* Image thumbnails from the Gallery app
* Previews from the Files app
* The search index from the full-text search app
* Third-party app data

There may be other files that are not encrypted. Only files that are
exposed to third-party storage providers are guaranteed to be encrypted.

[[ldap-and-other-external-user-back-ends]]
LDAP and Other External User Back-ends
--------------------------------------

If you use an external user back-end, such as an LDAP or Samba server,
and you change a user’s password on that back-end, the user will be
prompted to change their ownCloud login to match on their next ownCloud
login. The user will need both their old and new passwords to do this.
If you have enabled the recovery key then you can change a user’s
password in the ownCloud Users panel to match their back-end password
and then — of course — notify the user and give them their new password.

[[occ-encryption-commands]]
== occ Encryption Commands

If you have shell access, you may use the `occ` command to perform
encryption operations. You also have additional options such as
decryption and creating a single master encryption key. See
encryption_label for detailed instructions on using `occ`.

[[view-current-encryption-status]]
=== View Current Encryption Status

Get the current encryption status and the loaded encryption module:

....
occ encryption:status
 - enabled: false
 - defaultModule: OC_DEFAULT_MODULE
....

This is equivalent to checking *Enable server-side encryption* on your
Admin page:

....
occ encryption:enable
Encryption enabled

Default module: OC_DEFAULT_MODULE
....

[[list-available-encryption-modules]]
=== List Available Encryption Modules

To list the available encryption modules:

....
occ encryption:list-modules
 - OC_DEFAULT_MODULE: Default encryption module [default*]
....

Select a different default Encryption module (currently the only
available module is `OC_DEFAULT_MODULE`):

....
occ encryption:set-default-module [Module ID].
....

The [module ID] is taken from the `encryption:list-modules` command.

[[encrypt-and-decrypt-data-files-for-all-users]]
=== Encrypt and Decrypt Data Files For All Users

For performance reasons, when you enable encryption on an ownCloud
server only new and changed files are encrypted. This command gives you
the option to encrypt all files. You must first put your ownCloud server
into single-user mode to prevent any user activity until encryption is
completed:

....
occ maintenance:singleuser --on
Single user mode is currently enabled
....

Then run `occ`:

....
occ encryption:encrypt-all

You are about to start encrypting all files stored in your ownCloud.
It will depend on the encryption module you use which files get encrypted.
Depending on the number and size of your files this can take some time.
Please make sure that no users access their files during this process!

Do you really want to continue? (y/n)
....

When you type `y` it creates a key pair for each of your users, and then
encrypts their files, displaying progress until all user files are
encrypted.

Decrypt all user data files, or optionally a single user:

....
occ encryption:decrypt-all [username]
....

View current location of keys:

....
occ encryption:show-key-storage-root
Current key storage root:  default storage location (data/)
....

[[move-key-location]]
=== Move Key Location

Move keys to a different root folder, either locally or on a different
server. The folder must already exist, be owned by root and your HTTP
group, and be restricted to root and your HTTP group. This example is
for Ubuntu Linux. Note that the new folder is relative to your `occ`
directory:

....
mkdir /etc/keys
chown -R root:www-data /etc/keys
chmod -R 0770 /etc/keys
occ encryption:change-key-storage-root ../../../etc/keys
Start to move keys:
   4 [============================]
Key storage root successfully changed to ../../../etc/keys
....

[[create-a-new-master-key]]
=== Create a New Master Key

Use this when you have:

* A single-sign-on infrastructure
* A fresh installation with no existing data
* Systems where encryption has not already been enabled

....
occ encryption:enable-master-key
....

IMPORTANT: It is not possible to disable it.

[[recreating-an-existing-master-key]]
=== Recreating an Existing Master Key

If the master key needs replacing, for example, because it has been compromised, xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#encryption[an occ command is available].
The command is `encryption:recreate-master-key`.
It replaces existing master key with new one and encrypts the files with the new key.

[[disabling-encryption-1]]
== Disabling Encryption

You may disable encryption only with `occ`. Make sure you have backups
of all the encryption keys, including those for all users. When you do,
put your ownCloud server into single-user mode, and then disable your
encryption module with this command:

....
occ maintenance:singleuser --on
occ encryption:disable
....

IMPORTANT: Encryption cannot be disabled without the user’s password or xref:how-to-enable-users-file-recovery-keys[file recovery key]. If you don’t have access to at least one of these then there is no way to decrypt all files.

Then, take it out of single-user mode when you are finished with this
command:

....
occ maintenance:singleuser --off
....

It is possible to disable encryption with the file recovery key, _if_ every user uses them.
If so, "decrypt all" will use it to decrypt all files.

NOTE: It is *not* planned to move this to the next user login or a background job. If that was done, then login passwords would need to be stored in the database, which could be a security issue.

[[files-not-encrypted]]
== Files Not Encrypted

Only the data in the files in `data/user/files` are encrypted, and not
the filenames or folder structures. These files are never encrypted:

* Existing files in the trash bin & Versions. Only new and changed files
after encryption is enabled are encrypted.
* Existing files in Versions
* Image thumbnails from the Gallery app
* Previews from the Files app
* The search index from the full-text search app
* Third-party app data

There may be other files that are not encrypted; only files that are
exposed to third-party storage providers are guaranteed to be encrypted.

[[ldap-and-other-external-user-back-ends-1]]
LDAP and Other External User Back-ends
--------------------------------------

If you use an external user back-end, such as an LDAP or Samba server,
and you change a user’s password on the back-end, the user will be
prompted to change their ownCloud login to match on their next ownCloud
login. The user will need both their old and new passwords to do this.
If you have enabled the Recovery Key, then you can change a user’s
password in the ownCloud Users panel to match their back-end password,
and then, of course, notify the user and give them their new password.

[[encryption-migration-to-owncloud-8.0]]
Encryption migration to ownCloud 8.0
------------------------------------

When you upgrade from older versions of ownCloud to ownCloud 8.0, you must manually migrate your encryption keys with the `occ` command after the upgrade is complete, like this example for CentOS: `sudo -u apache php occ encryption:migrate-keys`.
You must run xref:configuration/server/occcommand.adoc[occ] as your HTTP user.

[[encryption-migration-to-owncloud-8.1]]
Encryption migration to ownCloud 8.1
------------------------------------

The encryption backend has changed again in ownCloud 8.1, so you must
take some additional steps to migrate encryption correctly. If you do
not follow these steps you may not be able to access your files.

Before you start your upgrade, put your ownCloud server into `maintenance:singleuser` mode.
You must do this to prevent users and sync clients from accessing files before you have completed your encryption migration.

TIP: See xref:maintenance/enable_maintenance.adoc[the maintenance commands] for more information.

After your upgrade is complete, follow the steps in enable_encryption_label to enable the new encryption system.
Then click the *Start Migration* button on your Admin page to migrate your encryption keys, or use the `occ` command.
We strongly recommend using the `occ` command; the *Start Migration* button is for admins who do not have access to the console, for example, installations on shared hosting.

This example is for Debian/Ubuntu Linux:

....
$ sudo -u www-data php occ encryption:migrate
....

This example is for Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora Linux:

....
$ sudo -u apache php occ encryption:migrate
....

You must run `occ` as your HTTP user.
When you are finished, take your ownCloud server out of single user mode.
