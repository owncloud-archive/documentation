= Providing Default Files

You may distribute a set of default files and folders to all users by
placing them in the `owncloud/core/skeleton` directory on your ownCloud
server. These files appear only to new users after their initial login,
and existing users will not see files that are added to this directory
after their first login. The files in the skeleton directory are copied
into the users’ data directories, so they may change and delete the
files without affecting the originals.

This screenshot shows a set of photos in the skeleton directory.

They appear on the user’s ownCloud Files page just like any other files.

== Additional Configuration

The configuration option `skeletondirectory` available in your `config.php` allows you to configure the directory where the skeleton files are located. 
These files will be copied to the data directory of new users. 
Leave empty to not copy any skeleton files.

TIP: See xref:configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters.adoc[Sample Config PHP Parameters] for more the complete list of `config.php` options.
