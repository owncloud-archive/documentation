WebDAV
======

Use this backend to mount a directory from any WebDAV server, or another
ownCloud server.

You need the following information:

* Folder name: The name of your local mountpoint.
* The URL of the WebDAV or ownCloud server.
* Username and password for the remote server
* Secure https://: We always recommend https:// for security, though you
can leave this unchecked for http://.

Optionally, a `Remote Subfolder` can be specified to change the
destination directory. The default is to use the whole root.

CPanel users should install
https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/ALD/Web+Disk[Web Disk] to
enable WebDAV functionality.

See ../external_storage_configuration_gui for additional mount options
and information.

See auth_mechanisms for more information on authentication schemes.
