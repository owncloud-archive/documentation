= SFTP

ownCloud’s SFTP (FTP over an SSH tunnel) backend supports both password
and public key authentication.

The *Host* field is required; a port can be specified as part of the
*Host* field in the following format: `hostname.domain:port`. The
default port is 22 (SSH).

For public key authentication, you can generate a public/private key
pair from your *SFTP with secret key login* configuration.

After generating your keys, you need to copy your new public key to the
destination server to `.ssh/authorized_keys`. ownCloud will then use its
private key to authenticate to the SFTP server.

The default *Remote Subfolder* is the root directory (`/`) of the remote
SFTP server, and you may enter any directory you wish.

See ../external_storage_configuration_gui for additional mount options
and information.

See auth_mechanisms for more information on authentication schemes.
