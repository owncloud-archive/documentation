====================
Minimum Requirements
====================

Before you can develop ownCloud applications, as with developing other software
applications, you have to ensure that you have a working development
environment. 

To do that: 

- First, ensure that your development environment meets the minimum requirements 
- Then, create the core files that any ownCloud application needs 

There aren't many requirements that you're going to need to develop an
application. 
All that you need is:

- PHP, with a minimum version of 5.6, though ideally 7.1
- A copy of ownCloud core
- A working installation of ownCloud server

To find out more, read through :doc:`the Development Environment section <../general/devenv>`. 
When you've done everything that it suggests, you're ready to begin developing
an ownCloud application.
