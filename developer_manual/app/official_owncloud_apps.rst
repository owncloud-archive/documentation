======================
Official ownCloud Apps
======================

Documentation for the official ownCloud apps is maintained in their respective Github repositories.

Notifications
-------------

The `Notifications <https://github.com/owncloud/notifications>`_
app manages notifications inside ownCloud, allows other apps to create
notifications about important things that require user interaction and has an
endpoint for clients to read/display those notifications then. Currently the
notifications are only displayed in the Web UI, but it is also planned to
integrate the list of notifications into the desktop sync clients.

The documentation about the API and endpoints can be found in the
`wiki of the repository <https://github.com/owncloud/notifications/wiki>`_.

Others
------

The `Calendar app <https://github.com/owncloud/calendar-rework>`_ is a rework of the old Calendar app.

The `Updater App <https://github.com/owncloud/updater>`_ automates many steps of upgrading an ownCloud server.

The `Gallery App <https://github.com/owncloud/gallery/wiki>`_ lets you browse and view your images.
