SSL / Encryption App
====================

SSL (HTTPS) and file encryption/decryption can be offloaded to a processor's
AES-NI extension. This can both speed up these operations while lowering
processing overhead. This requires a processor with the `AES-NI instruction set
<http://wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set>`_.

Here are some examples how to check if your CPU / environment supports the
AES-NI extension:

* For each CPU core present: ``grep flags /proc/cpuinfo`` or as a summary for
  all cores: ``grep -m 1 ^flags /proc/cpuinfo`` If the result contains any
  ``aes``, the extension is present.

.. windows is not supported on 8.x
.. * On Windows you can run ``coreinfo`` from Sysinternals `Windows
.. Sysinternals
..  Download Coreinfo
..  <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc835722.aspx>`_ which
..  gives you details of the processor and extensions present. Note: you may
.. have
..  to run the command shell as administrator to get an output.

* Search eg. on the Intel web if the processor used supports the extension
  `Intel Processor Feature Filter
  <http://ark.intel.com/MySearch.aspx?AESTech=true>`_ You may set a filter by
  ``"AES New Instructions"`` to get a reduced result set.

* For versions of openssl >= 1.0.1, AES-NI does not work via an engine and
  will not show up in the ``openssl engine`` command. It is active by default
  on the supported hardware. You can check the openssl version via ``openssl
  version -a``

* If your processor supports AES-NI but it does not show up eg via grep or
  coreinfo, it is maybe disabled in the BIOS.

* If your environment runs virtualized, check the virtualization vendor for
  support.
