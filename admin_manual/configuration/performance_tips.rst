Performance Tips
================

The performance of ownCloud, like any `LAMP application<http://wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29>`_,
is dependent on all components of the stack.
Maximuming performance can be achieved by optimizing the operations and interactions
of the underlying network, hardware, operating systems, webservers, databases, and storage.

This guide cannot cover all possible configurations and will instead
cover tips that are specific to ownCloud or give the greatest benefit.

SSL / Encryption App
--------------------

SSL (HTTPS) and file encryption/decryption can be offloaded to a processors AES-NI extensions.
This can both speed up these operations while lowering processing overhead.
This requires a processor with the `AES-NI instruction set<http://wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set>`_.

OPcache Extension
-----------------

OPcache improves PHP performance by storing precompiled script bytecode in shared memory,
thereby removing the need for PHP to load and parse scripts on each request.
This extension is bundled with PHP 5.5.0 and later, and is available in PECL for PHP versions 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4.

Object Caching
--------------

ownCloud is written to take advantage of object caching.
Object caching can be done locally with the APCu extension,
or for distributed PHP environments using Memcached.
Memcached servers must be specified in the "memcached_servers" array in ownCloud's config file.

[Serving static files via web server](./xsendfile.rst)
-----------------------------------

[Using cron to perform background jobs](./background_jobs.rst#cron)
-------------------------------------

[Using MySQL instead of SQLite](./configuration_database.rst#configuring-a-mysql-or-mariadb-database)
-----------------------------

MySQL or MariaDB should be perfered because of the inherent performance limitations of SQLite.
