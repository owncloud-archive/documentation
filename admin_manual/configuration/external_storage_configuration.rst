Configuring External Storage (Configuration File)
=================================================

Since ownCloud 4.0 it is possible to configure the filesystem to mount external
storage providers into ownCloud's virtual file system. You can configure these
file systems by creating and editing :file:`data/mount.json`. This file contains
all settings in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. At the moment two
different types of entries exist:

-  **Group mounts:** each entry configures a mount for each user in group.
-  **User mounts:** each entry configures a mount for a single user or for all
   users.

For each type, there is a JSON array with the user/group name as key, and an
array of configuration entries as value. Each entry consist of the class name
of the storage backend and an array of backend specific options and will be
replaced by the user login. The template **$user** can be used in the mount
point or backend options. As of writing the following storage backends are
available for use:

-  Local file system
-  FTP (or FTPS)
-  SFTP
-  SMB
-  WebDAV
-  `Amazon S3`_
-  `Dropbox`_
-  `Google Drive`_
-  `OpenStack Swift`_

Please keep in mind that some formatting has been applied and carriage returns
have been added for better readability. In the :file:`data/mount.json` all
values need to be concatenated and written in a row without these modifications!

It is recommended to use the :doc:`Web-GUI <external_storage_configuration_gui>` in the
administrator panel to add, remove or modify mount options to prevent any problems!

Example
-------

.. code-block:: json

    {"group":{
        "admin":{
            "\/$user\/files\/Admin_Stuff":{
                "class":"\\OC\\Files\\Storage\\Local",
                "options":{ ... },
                "priority":150
                }
            }
        }
     "user":{
        "all":{
            "\/$user\/files\/Pictures":{
                "class":"\\OC\\Files\\Storage\\DAV",
                "options":{ ... },
                "priority":100
                }
            }
        "someuser":{
            "\/someuser\/files\/Music":{
                "class":"\\OC\\Files\\Storage\\FTP",
                "options":{ ... },
                "priority":100
                }
            }
        }
    }

Priorities
----------

An advanced feature is available, only configurable directly in
:file:`data/mount.json`, which allows mount configurations to have an associated
priority. When two or more valid mount configurations exist for the same mount point,
the one with the highest priority (defined by the largest number) will take precedence
and become the active mount for the user.

Each backend has a default priority, assigned when a mount configuration with that
backend is created. The default priority will be shown in the example section for
each backend below. Should a backend not provide a default priority, a value of 100
will be used.

There is also a concept of priority types, to preserve compatibility with
previous mount configuration parsing. Mount configurations are evaluated in the
following order, with later mount types always overriding a previous mount type:

-  user -> all : global mount configurations
-  group : group mount configurations
-  user (not all) : per-user mount configurations
-  :file:`data/$user/mount.json` : personal mount configurations

Note regarding temporary disk space needs
-----------------------------------------

Not all external storage types are currently enabled for or do support streaming.
Therefore ownCloud needs temporary space to buffer data for transfers. This can occur 
when there are many concurrent users transferring data with a higher volume over a small 
bandwidth wire. ownCloud may need in these cases an amount of temporary space which could 
exeed the server capabilities. Example: 100 concurrent users uploading each a file having 
300MB with a total transfer trime of 6000s (1h 40min). The temporary space needed 
by ownCloud for this period of time is 30GB. Even though it is not mandatory,
the location of the temp directory used by ownCloud can be configured manually.
To do so, you need to maintain the 'tempdirectory' parameter described in
config.sample.php

As of writing, following external storage list uses temp files for up/download:

* FTP
* SMB / SMB_OC
* WebDAV
* Amazon S3
* Dropbox
* Google Drive
* OpenStack SWIFT

External storage list that uses direct file streaming:

* Local
* SFTP


Backends
--------

Local Filesystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The local filesystem backend mounts a folder on the server into the virtual
filesystem, the class to be used is **\\OC\\Files\\Storage\\Local**\  and
takes the following options:

-  **datadir** : the path to the local directory to be mounted


Example
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: json

    { "class":"\\OC\\Files\\Storage\\Local",
      "options":{ "datadir":"\/mnt\/additional_storage" },
      "priority":150
    }

.. note:: You must ensure that the web server has sufficient permissions on the folder.

FTP (or FTPS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FTP backend mounts a folder on a remote FTP server into the virtual
filesystem and is part of the ‘External storage support’ app, the class
to be used is **\\OC\\Files\\Storage\\FTP**\  and takes the following
options:

   server instead of ftp:// (optional, defaults to false)
-  **root**: the folder inside the ftp server to mount (optional, defaults
   to ‘/’)


Example
^^^^^^^
