Permanently Delete Files
------------------------

Files in the Deleted Files
folder can be permanently deleted.
To do this, either select the check box next to the file (or for bulk deletion – files) and select Delete in the upper right corner.
Or hover over the file and select the “x”.
See figure in section
.

Nested files and restore
------------------------

If, for instance, the directory structure within ownCloud is
*~/public/support/documentation/ownCloud undelete*
.

Delete entire directory structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the public folder is deleted, all child folders/files will also be deleted.

|100000000000052F000000C2867B7294_png|

Suppose the file “ownCloud undelete.docx” was still required.
A restore of the file will place it in the ‘root’ directory of the Files folder.


Delete only the file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the file “ownCloud undelete.docx”
was accidentally deleted, it may be restored following the steps described in section
.
The restore will place the file back into the directory structure from where it came.

Delete the file then the directory structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the file “ownCloud undelete.docs”
is deleted, then the entire directory structure is deleted, the file will appear in the ‘root’ of the Deleted Files folder.

|1000000000000523000000C6F786381C_png|

A restore of “ownCloud undelete.docx”
will place it in the user’s ownCloud root directory.

Shared files and restore
------------------------

When a
shared file is deleted, the file will be deleted from the shared to user as well.
Upon restore of the file by the file owner, the file is no longer shared.

Restore files with Versions
---------------------------

When a file which has versions has been deleted, and then restored, the versions will exist upon restoration.
