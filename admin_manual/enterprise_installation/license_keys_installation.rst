License Keys

Introduction
------------

You'll need to install a license key to use ownCloud 8 Enterprise Subscription. There are two types of license keys: one is a free 
30-day trial key. The other is a full license key for Enterprise Subscription customers.

You can `download and try ownCloud 8 Enterprise Subscription for 30 days for free <https://owncloud.com/download/>`_, which 
auto-generates a free 30-day key. When this key expires your ownCloud installation is not removed, so when 
you become an Enterprise Subscription customer you can enter your new key to regain access. See 
`How to Buy ownCloud <https://owncloud.com/how-to-buy-owncloud/>`_ for sales and  contact information.

Configuration
-------------

Once you get your Enterprise Subscription license key, it needs to be copied to your ownCloud configuration file, 
``config/config.php`` file like this example::

  'license-key' => 'test-20150101-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-YYYYYYâ€™,

Each running instance of ownCloud requires a license key. Keys will 
work across upgrades without issue, so new keys will not be required when you upgrade your 
ownCloud Enterprise Subscription to a new version.
