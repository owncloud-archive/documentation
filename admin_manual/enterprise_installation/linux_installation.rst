Installing ownCloud Enterprise Edition on Linux
===============================================

The recommended method for installing and maintaining your ownCloud Enterprise 
Subscription is with your Linux package manager. Configure your package manager to 
use the ownCloud Enterprise Subscription repository, import the signing key, and then 
install and update ownCloud like any other software package. Please refer to 
the ``README - ownCloud Package Installation.txt`` document in your account at 
`Customer.owncloud.com <https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud/>`_ account.

After you have completed your initial installation of ownCloud as detailed in 
the README, follow the instructions in :doc:`../installation/installation_wizard` to finish 
setting up ownCloud.

SELinux
-------

Linux distributions that use SELinux need to take some extra steps so that 
ownCloud will operate correctly under SELinux. Please see 
:doc:`../installation/selinux_configuration` for some recommended configurations.
