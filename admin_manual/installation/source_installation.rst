Manual Installation on Linux
============================

Installing ownCloud on Linux from our Open Build Service packages is the 
preferred method (see :doc:`linux_installation`). These are maintained by 
ownCloud engineers, and you can use your package manager to keep your ownCloud 
server up-to-date.

.. note:: Enterprise customers should refer to  
   :doc:`../enterprise_installation/linux_installation`

If there are no packages for your Linux distribution, or you prefer installing
from the source tarball, you can setup ownCloud from scratch using a classic
LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP). This document provides
a complete walk-through for installing ownCloud on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Server with
Apache and MariaDB, using `the ownCloud .tar archive
<https://owncloud.org/install/>`_.

.. note:: Admins of SELinux-enabled distributions such as CentOS, Fedora, and 
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux may need to set new rules to enable installing 
   ownCloud. See :ref:`selinux_tips_label` for a suggested configuration.

.. _prerequisites_label:

Prerequisites
-------------

The ownCloud .tar archive contains all of the required PHP modules. This section 
lists all required and optional PHP modules.  Consult the `PHP manual 
<http://php.net/manual/en/extensions.php>`_ for more information on modules. 
Your Linux distribution should have packages for all required modules. You can 
check the presence of a module by typing ``php -m | grep -i <module_name>``. 
If you get a result, the module is present.

Required:

* php5 (>= 5.6)
* PHP module ctype
* PHP module dom
* PHP module GD
* PHP module iconv
* PHP module JSON
* PHP module libxml (Linux package libxml2 must be >=2.7.0)
* PHP module mb multibyte
* PHP module posix
* PHP module SimpleXML
* PHP module XMLWriter
* PHP module zip
* PHP module zlib

Database connectors (pick the one for your database:)

* PHP module sqlite (>= 3, usually not recommended for performance reasons)
* PHP module pdo_mysql (MySQL/MariaDB)
* PHP module pgsql (requires PostgreSQL >= 9.0)

*Recommended* packages:

* PHP module curl (highly recommended, some functionality, e.g. HTTP user
  authentication, depends on this)
* PHP module fileinfo (highly recommended, enhances file analysis performance)
* PHP module bz2 (recommended, required for extraction of apps)
* PHP module intl (increases language translation performance and fixes sorting 
  of non-ASCII characters)
* PHP module mcrypt (increases file encryption performance)
* PHP module openssl (required for accessing HTTPS resources)

Required for specific apps:

* PHP module ldap (for LDAP integration)
* PHP module ftp (for FTP storage / external user authentication)
* PHP module imap (for external user authentication)
* PHP module smbclient  (SMB/CIFS integration)
  
.. note:: SMB/Windows Network Drive mounts require the PHP module smbclient version 0.8.0+; see
  :doc:`../configuration_files/external_storage/smb`.

Recommended for specific apps (*optional*):

* PHP module exif (for image rotation in pictures app)
* PHP module gmp (for SFTP storage)

For enhanced server performance (*optional*) select one of the following 
memcaches:

* PHP module apc
* PHP module apcu
* PHP module memcached
* PHP module redis (>= 2.2.6+, required for Transactional File Locking)

See :doc:`../configuration_server/caching_configuration` to learn how to select 
and configure a memcache.

For preview generation (*optional*):

* PHP module imagick
* avconv or ffmpeg
* OpenOffice or LibreOffice

For command line processing (*optional*):

* PHP module pcntl (enables command interruption by pressing ``ctrl-c``)

You don’t need the WebDAV module for your Web server (i.e. Apache’s 
``mod_webdav``), as ownCloud has a built-in WebDAV server of its own, SabreDAV. 
If ``mod_webdav`` is enabled you must disable it for ownCloud. (See 
:ref:`apache_configuration_label` for an example configuration.)

MySQL/MariaDB Require InnoDB
----------------------------

The InnoDB storage engine is required, and MyISAM is not supported, see:
:ref:`db-storage-engine-label`.
  
.. _ubuntu_installation_label:  

Example Installation on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Server
-----------------------------------------------

On a machine running a pristine Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server, install the
required and recommended modules for a typical ownCloud installation, using
Apache and MariaDB, by issuing the following commands in a terminal::

    apt-get install apache2 mariadb-server libapache2-mod-php7.0
    apt-get install php7.0-gd php7.0-json php7.0-mysql php7.0-curl
    apt-get install php7.0-intl php7.0-mcrypt php-imagick
    apt-get install php7.0-zip php7.0-xml php7.0-mbstring

The remaining steps are analogous to the installation on Ubuntu 14.04 as shown
below.

Example Installation on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Server
-----------------------------------------------

On a machine running a pristine Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server, install the
required and recommended modules for a typical ownCloud installation, using
Apache and MariaDB, by issuing the following commands in a terminal::

    apt-get install apache2 mariadb-server libapache2-mod-php5
    apt-get install php5-gd php5-json php5-mysql php5-curl
    apt-get install php5-intl php5-mcrypt php5-imagick

* This installs the packages for the ownCloud core system. 
  ``libapache2-mod-php5`` provides the following PHP extensions: ``bcmath bz2 
  calendar Core ctype date dba dom ereg exif fileinfo filter ftp gettext hash 
  iconv libxml mbstring mhash openssl pcre Phar posix Reflection session shmop 
  SimpleXML soap sockets SPL standard sysvmsg sysvsem sysvshm tokenizer wddx 
  xml xmlreader xmlwriter zip zlib``. If you are planning 
  on running additional apps, keep in mind that they might require additional 
  packages.  See :ref:`prerequisites_label` for details.

* At the installation of the MySQL/MariaDB server, you will be prompted to 
  create a root password. Be sure to remember your password as you will need it 
  during ownCloud database setup.

Now download the archive of the latest ownCloud version:

* Go to the `ownCloud Download Page <https://owncloud.org/install>`_.
* Go to **Download ownCloud Server > Download > Archive file for 
  server owners** and download either the tar.bz2 or .zip archive.
* This downloads a file named owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2 or owncloud-x.y.z.zip 
  (where x.y.z is the version number).
* Download its corresponding checksum file, e.g. owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.md5, 
  or owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.sha256. 
* Verify the MD5 or SHA256 sum::
   
    md5sum -c owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.md5 < owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2
    sha256sum -c owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.sha256 < owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2
    md5sum  -c owncloud-x.y.z.zip.md5 < owncloud-x.y.z.zip
    sha256sum  -c owncloud-x.y.z.zip.sha256 < owncloud-x.y.z.zip
    
* You may also verify the PGP signature::
    
    wget https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.asc
    wget https://owncloud.org/owncloud.asc
    gpg --import owncloud.asc
    gpg --verify owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2.asc owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2
  
* Now you can extract the archive contents. Run the appropriate unpacking 
  command for your archive type::

    tar -xjf owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2
    unzip owncloud-x.y.z.zip

* This unpacks to a single ``owncloud`` directory. Copy the ownCloud directory 
  to its final destination. When you are running the Apache HTTP server you may 
  safely install ownCloud in your Apache document root::

    cp -r owncloud /path/to/webserver/document-root

  where ``/path/to/webserver/document-root`` is replaced by the 
  document root of your Web server::
    
    cp -r owncloud /var/www

On other HTTP servers it is recommended to install ownCloud outside of the 
document root.

.. _binlog_format_label:

BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT
-------------------------

If your ownCloud installation fails and you see this in your ownCloud log::

 An unhandled exception has been thrown: exception ‘PDOException’ with message 
 'SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1665 Cannot execute statement: impossible to 
 write to binary log since BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT and at least one table 
 uses a storage engine limited to row-based logging. InnoDB is limited to 
 row-logging when transaction isolation level is READ COMMITTED or READ 
 UNCOMMITTED.'

See :ref:`db-binlog-label`.

.. _apache_configuration_label:
   
Apache Web Server Configuration
-------------------------------

On Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives, Apache installs with a useful
configuration so all you have to do is create
a :file:`/etc/apache2/sites-available/owncloud.conf` file with these lines in
it, replacing the **Directory** and other file paths with your own file paths::
   
  Alias /owncloud "/var/www/owncloud/"
   
  <Directory /var/www/owncloud/>
    Options +FollowSymlinks
    AllowOverride All

   <IfModule mod_dav.c>
    Dav off
   </IfModule>

   SetEnv HOME /var/www/owncloud
   SetEnv HTTP_HOME /var/www/owncloud

  </Directory>
  
Then create a symlink to :file:`/etc/apache2/sites-enabled`::

  ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/owncloud.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/owncloud.conf
  
Additional Apache Configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* For ownCloud to work correctly, we need the module ``mod_rewrite``. Enable it 
  by running::

    a2enmod rewrite
  
  Additional recommended modules are ``mod_headers``, ``mod_env``, ``mod_dir`` and ``mod_mime``::
  
    a2enmod headers
    a2enmod env
    a2enmod dir
    a2enmod mime
  
  If you're running ``mod_fcgi`` instead of the standard ``mod_php`` also enable::
  
    a2enmod setenvif

* You must disable any server-configured authentication for ownCloud, as it 
  uses Basic authentication internally for DAV services. If you have turned on 
  authentication on a parent folder (via e.g. an ``AuthType Basic``
  directive), you can turn off the authentication specifically for the ownCloud 
  entry. Following the above example configuration file, add the following line 
  in the ``<Directory`` section::

    Satisfy Any

* When using SSL, take special note of the ``ServerName``. You should specify one in 
  the  server configuration, as well as in the `CommonName` field of the 
  certificate. If you want your ownCloud to be reachable via the internet, then 
  set both of these to the domain you want to reach your ownCloud server.

* Now restart Apache::

     service apache2 restart

* If you're running ownCloud in a sub-directory and want to use CalDAV or 
  CardDAV clients make sure you have configured the correct 
  :ref:`service-discovery-label` URLs.

.. _enabling_ssl_label:

Enabling SSL
------------

.. note:: You can use ownCloud over plain HTTP, but we strongly encourage you to
          use SSL/TLS to encrypt all of your server traffic, and to protect 
          user's logins and data in transit.

Apache installed under Ubuntu comes already set-up with a simple
self-signed certificate. All you have to do is to enable the ``ssl`` module and
the default site. Open a terminal and run::

     a2enmod ssl
     a2ensite default-ssl
     service apache2 reload

.. note:: Self-signed certificates have their drawbacks - especially when you
          plan to make your ownCloud server publicly accessible. You might want
          to consider getting a certificate signed by a commercial signing
          authority. Check with your domain name registrar or hosting service 
          for good deals on commercial certificates.   
    
.. _installation_wizard_label:
    
Installation Wizard
-------------------

After restarting Apache you must complete your installation by running either 
the graphical Installation Wizard, or on the command line with the ``occ`` 
command. To enable this, temporarily change the ownership on your ownCloud 
directories to your HTTP user (see :ref:`strong_perms_label` to learn how to 
find your HTTP user)::

 chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/owncloud/
 
.. note:: Admins of SELinux-enabled distributions may need to write new SELinux 
   rules to complete their ownCloud installation; see 
   :ref:`selinux_tips_label`. 

To use ``occ`` see :doc:`command_line_installation`. 

To use the graphical Installation Wizard see :doc:`installation_wizard`.

Setting Strong Directory Permissions
------------------------------------

After completing installation, you must immediately set the directory 
permissions in your ownCloud installation as strictly as possible for stronger 
security. Please refer to :ref:`strong_perms_label`.

Now your ownCloud server is ready to use.

.. _selinux_tips_label:

SELinux Configuration Tips
--------------------------

See :doc:`selinux_configuration` for a suggested configuration for 
SELinux-enabled distributions such as Fedora and CentOS.

.. _php_ini_tips_label:

php.ini Configuration Notes
---------------------------

.. IMPORTANT:: 
   From ownCloud 9.1.2, ensure that you have `session.auto_start
   = 0 <php_session_autostart` in your configuration. If not, you may have
   issues logging in to ownCloud via the WebUI.

Keep in mind that changes to ``php.ini`` may have to be configured in more than one 
INI file. This can be the case, for example, for the ``date.timezone`` setting.

**php.ini - used by the Web server:**
::

   /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
 or
   /etc/php5/fpm/php.ini
 or ...

**php.ini - used by the php-cli and so by ownCloud CRON jobs:**
::

  /etc/php5/cli/php.ini


.. _php_fpm_tips_label:

php-fpm Configuration Notes
---------------------------

**System environment variables**

When you are using ``php-fpm``, system environment variables like 
``PATH``, ``TMP`` or others are not automatically populated in the same way as 
when using ``php-cli``. A PHP call like ``getenv('PATH');`` can therefore 
return an empty result. So you may need to manually configure environment 
variables in the appropriate ``php-fpm`` ini/config file. 

Here are some example root paths for these ini/config files:

+--------------------+-----------------------+
| Ubuntu/Mint        | CentOS/Red Hat/Fedora |
+--------------------+-----------------------+ 
| ``/etc/php5/fpm/`` | ``/etc/php-fpm.d/``   |
+--------------------+-----------------------+ 

In both examples, the ``ini/config`` file is called ``www.conf``, and depending
on the distribution or customizations which you have made, it may be in
a sub-directory.

Usually, you will find some or all of the environment variables 
already in the file, but commented out like this::

	;env[HOSTNAME] = $HOSTNAME
	;env[PATH] = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
	;env[TMP] = /tmp
	;env[TMPDIR] = /tmp
	;env[TEMP] = /tmp

Uncomment the appropriate existing entries. Then run ``printenv PATH`` to 
confirm your paths, for example::

        $ printenv PATH
        /home/user/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:
        /sbin:/bin:/

If any of your system environment variables are not present in the file then 
you must add them.

When you are using shared hosting or a control panel to manage your ownCloud
virtual machine or server, the configuration files are almost certain to be
located somewhere else, for security and flexibility reasons, so check your
documentation for the correct locations.

Please keep in mind that it is possible to create different settings for 
``php-cli`` and ``php-fpm``, and for different domains and Web sites. 
The best way to check your settings is with :ref:`label-phpinfo`.

**Maximum upload size**

If you want to increase the maximum upload size, you will also have to modify 
your ``php-fpm`` configuration and increase the ``upload_max_filesize`` and 
``post_max_size`` values. You will need to restart ``php5-fpm`` and your HTTP 
server in order for these changes to be applied.

**.htaccess notes for Apache**

ownCloud comes with its own ``owncloud/.htaccess`` file. Because ``php-fpm`` can't 
read PHP settings in ``.htaccess`` these settings and permissions must be set
in the ``owncloud/.user.ini`` file.
