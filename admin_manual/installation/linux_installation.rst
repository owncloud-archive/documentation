===================================
Preferred Linux Installation Method
===================================

Installation Quick Start
------------------------

See the :doc:`system_requirements` for the recommended ownCloud setup and
supported platforms.

Installing ownCloud Server (the free community edition) on Linux from our `Open
Build Service`_ packages is the preferred method. These are maintained by
ownCloud engineers, and you can use your package manager to keep your ownCloud
server up-to-date.  Follow the instructions for your distro to add the ownCloud
Open Build Service repository, download and install the repository signing key,
and install ownCloud. Then run the Installation Wizard to complete your
installation. (see :doc:`installation_wizard`).

.. note:: Do not move the folders provided by these packages after the
   installation, as this will break updates.

Installing ownCloud Enterprise Subscription
-------------------------------------------

See :doc:`../enterprise_installation/linux_installation` for instructions on
installing ownCloud Enterprise Subscription.

Downgrading Not Supported
-------------------------

Downgrading is not supported and risks corrupting your data! If you want to
revert to an older ownCloud version, install it from scratch and then restore
your data from backup. Before doing this, file a support ticket (if you have
paid support) or ask for help in the ownCloud forums to see if your issue can be
resolved without downgrading.

Additional Installation Guides and Notes
----------------------------------------

See :doc:`installation_wizard` for important steps such as choosing the best
database and setting correct directory permissions.

See :doc:`selinux_configuration` for a suggested configuration for
SELinux-enabled distributions such as Fedora and CentOS.

If your distribution is not listed, your Linux distribution may maintain its
own
ownCloud packages, or you may prefer to install from source code (see
:doc:`source_installation`).

**Archlinux:** The current `stable version`_ is in the
official community repository, and more packages are in
the `Arch User Repository`_.

.. _stable version: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/owncloud
.. _Arch User Repository: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=owncloud

**Mageia:** The `Mageia Wiki`_ has a good page on installing ownCloud from the
Mageia software repository.

.. _Mageia Wiki: https://wiki.mageia.org/en/OwnCloud

**Debian/Ubuntu:** The package installs an additional Apache config file to
``/etc/apache2/conf-available/owncloud.conf`` which contains an ``Alias`` to the
owncloud installation directory as well as some more needed configuration
options.

**Running ownCloud in a subdir**: If you're running ownCloud in a subdir and
want to use CalDAV or CardDAV clients make sure you have configured the correct
:ref:`service-discovery-label` URLs.

**Note for MySQL/MariaDB environments**: Please refer to :ref:`db-binlog-label`
on how to correctly configure your environment if you have binary logging enabled.
