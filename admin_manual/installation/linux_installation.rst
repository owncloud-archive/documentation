===================================
Preferred Linux Installation Method
===================================

Supported Distribution Packages
-------------------------------

Installing ownCloud on Linux from the `openSUSE Build Service`_ packages is the 
preferred method. These are maintained by ownCloud engineers, and you can use 
your package manager to keep your ownCloud server up-to-date. Ready-to-use 
packages are available at the ownCloud repository for a variety of Linux 
distributions. Follow the instructions for your distro to add the oBS 
repository, download and install the repository signing key, and install 
ownCloud. Then run the Installation Wizard to complete your installation. (see 
:doc:`installation_wizard`).

If your distribution is not listed, your Linux distribution may maintain its own 
ownCloud packages, or you may prefer to install from source code (see 
:doc:`source_installation`).
