:abbr:`UCS (Univention Corporate Server)`.

Pre configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ownCloud makes use of the UCR, the Univention Configuration Registry. The values
are read during installation, most of them can be changed later, too.
Changes done directly via ownCloud are not taken over to UCR. We think we found
sane defaults, nevertheless you might have your own requirements. The
installation script will listen to the UCR keys listed below. If want
to override any default setting, simply add the key in question to the UCR and
assign your required value.

If you want to override the default settings, simply create the key in
question in the UCR and assign your required value, for example::

  ucr set owncloud/user/enabled=1

or via UMC:

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, we are ready to install ownCloud. The recommended method is by using the
UCS App Center.

UCS App Center
""""""""""""""

Open the Univention Management Console and choose the App Center module. You
will see a variety of available applications, including ownCloud. You can
install and upgrade ownCloud from the App Center.

Postconfiguration (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is only one local admin user “owncloudadmin”, you can find the password in
`/etc/owncloudadmin.secret`. Use this account, if you want to change basic
ownCloud settings.

In the installation process a virtual host is set up (Apache is required
therefore). If you want to modify the settings, edit
:file:`/etc/apache2/sites-available/owncloud` and restart the Web server. You
might want to do it to enable HTTPS connections. Besides that, you can edit the
**.htaccess-File in /var/www/owncloud/**. In the latter file the
PHP limits for file transfer are also specified.

Using ownCloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you decided to enable every user by default to use ownCloud, simply
open up http://myserver.com/owncloud/ and log in with your LDAP
credentials and enjoy.

If you did not, go to the UMC and enable the users who shall have access
(see picture below). Then, login at http://myserver.com/owncloud/ with
your LDAP credentials.

.. image:: ../images/ucsint1.png

Updating users can also be done by the script
:file:`/usr/share/owncloud/update-users.sh` . It takes the following UCR
variables as parameters: **owncloud/user/enabled** for enabling or disabling,
**owncloud/user/quota** as the Quota value and **owncloud/join/users/filter** as
LDAP filter to select the users to update.

Groups
""""""

Groups can be
enabled and disabled via UCM as shown in the screen shot below.

.. image:: ../images/ucsint.png

Another way to enable or disable groups is to use the script
:file:`/usr/share/owncloud/update-groups.sh`. Currently, it takes an argument
which can be 1=enable groups or 0=disable groups. The filter applied is
taken from the UCR variable **owncloud/join/groups/filter**. If it is
empty, a message will be displayed.
