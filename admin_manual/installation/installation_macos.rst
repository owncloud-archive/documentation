This relies on `MAMP`_, which provides the required environment.

#. Install MAMP and run it.
#. Go to ‘Preferences‘, open the ‘Apache’ tab and set ‘Document Root’ to
   **/Users/<YOUR USER NAME>/Sites**, so your Sites directory will be
   used as Apache root.
#. Download `ownCloud <https://download.owncloud.com/download/community/owncloud-latest.zip>`_
#. Extract it

::

  unzip owncloud-latest.zip -d ~/Sites/

5. Now you can set it up by going to http://localhost:8888/owncloud
