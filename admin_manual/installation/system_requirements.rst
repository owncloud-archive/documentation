===================
System Requirements
===================

Memory
------

Memory requirements for running an ownCloud server are greatly variable,
depending on the numbers of users and files, and volume of server activity.
ownCloud officially requires a minimum of 128MB RAM. But, we recommend
a minimum of 512MB. 

.. note:: *Consideration for low memory environments*
   
  Scanning of files is committed internally in 10k files chunks. 
  Based on tests, server memory usage for scanning greater than 10k files uses about 75MB of additional memory.
