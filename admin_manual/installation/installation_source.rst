Manual Installation
-------------------

If you do not want to use packages, here is how you setup ownCloud on from scratch
using a classic :abbr:`LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)` setup:

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run ownCloud, your webserver must have the following installed:

* php5 (>= 5.3)
* php5-gd
* php-xml-parser

And as *optional* dependencies:

* php5-intl
* php5-sqlite (>= 3)
* php5-mysql
* php5-pgsql (or php-pgsql depending on your distro)
* smbclient
* php5-curl
* curl
* libcurl3

You have to install at least one of php5-sqlite, php5-pgsql or php5-mysql, depending
on which of the three database systems (SQLite, PostgreSQL or MySQL) you want to use
and activate its PDO module in the **php.ini**.

smbclient is only used if you want to mount SMB shares to your ownCloud.
The curl packages are needed for some apps (e.g. http user authentication)


Commands for Ubuntu and Debian (run as root):

::

  apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-gd php-xml-parser php5-intl
  apt-get install php5-sqlite php5-mysql php5-pgsql smbclient curl libcurl3 php5-curl

If you are running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS you will need to update your PHP from
this `PHP PPA`_:

::

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install php5

.. todo:: Document other distributions.

You don’t need any WebDAV support of your webserver (i.e. apache’s mod_webdav)
to access your ownCloud data via WebDAV, ownCloud has a WebDAV server built in.
In fact, you should make sure that any built-in WebDAV module of your webserver
is disabled (at least for the ownCloud directory), as it can interfere with
ownCloud's built-in WebDAV support.

Extract ownCloud and Copy to Your Webserver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  tar -xjf path/to/downloaded/owncloud-x.x.x.tar.bz2
  cp -r owncloud /path/to/your/webserver

Set the Directory Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The owner of your webserver must own the apps/, data/ and config/ directories
in your ownCloud install. You can do this by running the following command for
the apps, data and config directories.

For debian based distros like Ubuntu, Debian or Linux Mint and Gentoo use::

  chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/your/owncloud/install/data

For ArchLinux use::

  chown -R http:http /path/to/your/owncloud/install/data

Fedora users should use::

  chown -R apache:apache /path/to/your/owncloud/install/data

.. note:: The **data/** directory will only be created after setup has run (see below) and is not present by default in the tarballs.

Enable .htaccess and mod_rewrite if Running Apache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are running the apache webserver, it is recommended that you enable
**.htaccess** files as ownCloud uses them to enhance security and allows you to
use webfinger. To enable .htaccess files you need to ensure that
**AllowOverride** is set to **All** in the **Directory /var/www/** section of
your virtual host file. This is usually in :file:`/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default`.  If your distro supports **a2enmod** run the following commands::

	a2enmod rewrite

In distros that do not come with a2enmod the :file:`/etc/httpd/httpd.conf` needs to be changed to enable **mod_rewrite**

Then restart apache. For Ubuntu systems (or distros using updstart) use::

	service apache2 restart

For systemd systems (fedora, ArchLinux, Fedora, OpenSuse) use::

	systemctl restart httpd.service

In order for the maximum upload size to be configurable, the .htaccess file in the ownCloud folder needs to be made writable by the server.

Follow the Install Wizard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open your web browser and navigate to your ownCloud instance. If you are
installing ownCloud on the same machine as you will access the install wizard
from, the url will be: http://localhost/ (or http://localhost/owncloud).

For basic installs we recommend SQLite as it is easy to setup (ownCloud will do it for you). For larger installs you should use MySQL or PostgreSQL. Click on the Advanced options to show the configuration options. You may enter admin
credentials and let ownCloud create its own database user, or enter a preconfigured user.  If you are not using apache as the webserver, please set the data directory to a location outside of the document root. See the advanced
install settings.

Test your Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Login and start using ownCloud. Check your web servers errror log. If it shows
error, you might have missed a dependency or hit a bug with your particular
configuration.

If you plan on using the Webfinger app and
your ownCloud installation is not in the webroot then you’ll have to manually
link :file:`/var/www/.well-known` to :file:`/path/to/your/owncloud/.well-known`.
