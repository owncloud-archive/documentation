Manual Installation
-------------------

If you do not want to use packages, here is how you setup ownCloud from
scratch using a classic :abbr:`LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)` setup:

This document provides a complete walk-through for installing ownCloud
on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server with Apache and MySQL.
It also provides guidelines for installing it on other distributions,
web servers and database systems.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: This tutorial assumes you have terminal access to the machine you want
          to install ownCloud on. Although this is not an absolute requirement,
          installation without it is highly likely to require contacting your
          hoster (e.g. for installing required modules).

To run ownCloud, your web server must have the following installed:

* php5 (>= 5.3.8, minimum recommended 5.4)
* PHP module ctype
* PHP module dom
* PHP module GD
* PHP module iconv
* PHP module JSON
* PHP module libxml
* PHP module mb multibyte
* PHP module SimpleXML
* PHP module zip
* PHP module zlib

Database connectors (pick at least one):

* PHP module sqlite (>= 3, usually not recommendable for performance reasons)
* PHP module mysql
* PHP module pgsql (requires PostgreSQL >= 9.0)

*Recommended* packages:

* PHP module curl (highly recommended, some functionality, e.g. http user
  authentication, depends on this)
* PHP module fileinfo (highly recommended, enhances file analysis performance)
* PHP module bz2 (recommended, required for extraction of apps)
* PHP module intl (increases language translation performance and fixes sorting of non-ASCII characters)
* PHP module mcrypt (increases file encryption performance)
* PHP module openssl (required for accessing HTTPS resources)

Required for specific apps (if you use the mentioned app, you must install that
package):

* PHP module ldap (for ldap integration)
* smbclient (for SMB storage)
* PHP module ftp (for FTP storage)

Recommended for specific apps (*optional*):

* PHP module exif (for image rotation in pictures app)
* PHP module gmp (for SFTP storage)

For enhanced performance (*optional* / select only one of the following):

* PHP module apc
* PHP module apcu
* PHP module xcache

For preview generation (*optional*):

* PHP module imagick
* avconv or ffmpeg
* OpenOffice or libreOffice

**Remarks:**

* Please check your distribution, operating system or hosting partner documentation
  on how to install/enable these modules.

* Make sure your distribution's php version fulfils the version requirements
  specified above. If it doesn't, there might be custom repositories you can
  use. If you are e.g. running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, you can update your PHP using
  a custom `PHP PPA`_: ::

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install php5

* You don’t need any WebDAV support module for your web server (i.e. Apache’s
  mod_webdav) to access your ownCloud data via WebDAV. ownCloud has a built-in
  WebDAV server of its own.

Example installation on Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS Server
*************************************************
On a machine running a pristine Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS server, you would install the
required and recommended modules for a typical ownCloud installation, using
Apache and MySQL by issuing the following commands in a terminal::

	sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server libapache2-mod-php5
	sudo apt-get install php5-gd php5-json php5-mysql php5-curl
	sudo apt-get install php5-intl php5-mcrypt php5-imagick

**Remarks:**

* This installs the packages for the ownCloud core system. If you are planning on
  running additional apps, keep in mind that they might require additional packages.
  See the list above for details.

* At the execution of each of the above commands you might be prompted whether you
  want to continue; press "Y" for Yes (that is if your system language is English.
  You might have to press a different key if you have a different system language).

* At the installation of the MySQL server, you will be prompted for a root password.
  Be sure to remember the password you enter there for later use (you will need it
  during ownCloud database setup).

First, download the archive of the latest ownCloud version:

* Navigate to the `ownCloud Installation Page`_
* Click "Tar or Zip file"
* In the opening dialog, chose the "Linux" link.
* This will start the download of a file named owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2 (where
  x.y.z is the version number of the current latest version).
* Save this file on the machine you want to install ownCloud on.
* If that's a different machine than the one you are currently working on, use
  e.g. FTP to transfer the downloaded archive file there.
* Extract the archive contents. Open a terminal and run::

	cd path/to/downloaded/archive
	tar -xjf owncloud-x.y.z.tar.bz2

  where :code:`path/to/downloaded/archive` is to be replaced by the path where you
  put the downloaded archive, and x.y.z of course has to be replaced by the actual
  version number as in the file you have downloaded.

* Copy the ownCloud files to their final destination in the document root of your
  web server (you can skip this step if you already downloaded and extracted the
  files there)::

	sudo cp -r owncloud /path/to/your/webservers/document-root

  where ``/path/to/your/webservers/document-root``, needs to be replaced by the
  actual path where the document root of your web server is configured to be.

  * If you don't know where your web server's document root is located, consult
    its documentation. For Apache on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS for example, this would
    usually be ``/var/www``. So the concrete command to run would be::

	sudo cp -r owncloud /var/www

  * The above assumes you want to install ownCloud into a subdirectory "owncloud"
    on your web server. For installing it anywhere else, you'll have to adapt the
    above command accordingly.

Set the Directory Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user running your web server must own at least the config/, data/ and apps/
directories in your ownCloud installation folder so that you can configure ownCloud,
create/modify and delete your data files through ownCloud and install apps through
the web interface. If you are planning on also using the automatic updater app for
updating, the whole ``owncloud`` folder must be owned by (or at least be writable to)
the user running php on your system.

.. note:: When using an NFS mount for the data directory, do not change ownership as above.
          The simple act of mounting the drive will set proper permissions for ownCloud to
          write to the directory. Changing ownership as above could result in some issues
          if the NFS mount is lost.

* The generic command to run is::

    sudo chown -R <php-user>:<php-user> /path/to/your/webservers/document-root/owncloud

  where ``<php-user>`` is to be replaced by the user running php scripts, and
  ``/path/to/your/webservers/document-root/owncloud`` by the folder where the
  extracted ownCloud files are located.

* For Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server, where the ``owncloud`` folder was copied into the
  Apache document root at ``/var/www``, and the user running Apache and php
  scripts is called ``www-data``, this would mean you need to run::

	sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/owncloud

* For Arch Linux should run (as root):
  ::

	chown -R http:http /path/to/your/owncloud

* Fedora users should run (as root):
  ::

	chown -R apache:apache /path/to/your/owncloud
	
* openSUSE users should run (as root):
  ::

	chown -R wwwrun:www /path/to/your/owncloud


Web Server Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: You can use ownCloud over plain http, but we strongly encourage you to
          use SSL/TLS. If you don't use it, and you for example access your
          ownCloud over an unsecured WiFi, everyone in the same WiFi can grab
          your authentication data or the content of files synchronized while you
          are on the WiFi.

Apache is the recommended web server.

Apache Configuration
********************

Enabling SSL
............

An Apache installed under Ubuntu comes already set-up with a simple
self-signed certificate. All you have to do is to enable the ssl module and
the according site. Open a terminal and run::

	sudo a2enmod ssl
	sudo a2ensite default-ssl
	sudo service apache2 reload

If you are using a different distribution, check their documentation on how to
enable SSL.

.. note:: Self-signed certificates have their drawbacks - especially when you
          plan to make your ownCloud server publicly accessible. You might want
          to consider getting a certificate signed by an official signing
          authority. SSLShopper for example has an article on your
          `options for free SSL certificates`_.

Configuring ownCloud
....................

Since there was a change in the way versions 2.2 and 2.4 are configured,
you'll have to find out which Apache version you are using.

Usually you can do this by running one of the following commands::

	sudo apachectl -v
	apache2 -v

Example output::

	Server version: Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu)
	Server built:   Jul 12 2013 13:37:10

This indicates an Apache of the 2.2 version branch (as e.g. you will find on
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).

Example config for Apache 2.2:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Directory /path/to/your/owncloud/install>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>


Example config for Apache 2.4:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Directory /path/to/your/owncloud/install>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

* This config entry needs to go into the configuration file of the "site" you want
  to use.
* On a Ubuntu system, this typically is the "default-ssl" site (to be found in
  the :file:`/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl`).
* Edit the site file with your favorite editor (note that you'll need root
  permissions to modify that file). For Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, you could for example run
  the following command in a Terminal::

	sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl

* Add the entry shown above immediately before the line containing::

	</VirtualHost>

  (this should be one of the last lines in the file).

* A minimal site configuration file on Ubuntu 12.04 might look like this:

.. code-block:: xml

	<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
	<VirtualHost _default_:443>
		ServerName YourServerName
		ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
		DocumentRoot /var/www
		<Directory />
			Options FollowSymLinks
			AllowOverride None
		</Directory>
		<Directory /var/www/>
			Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
			AllowOverride None
			Order allow,deny
			allow from all
		</Directory>
		ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
		LogLevel warn
		CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/ssl_access.log combined
		SSLEngine on
		SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
		SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
		<FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$">
			SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
		</FilesMatch>
		<Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin>
			SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
		</Directory>
		BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
			nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
			downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
		BrowserMatch "MSIE [17-9]" ssl-unclean-shutdown
		<Directory /var/www/owncloud>
			Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
			AllowOverride All
			Order allow,deny
			Allow from all
			# add any possibly required additional directives here
			# e.g. the Satisfy directive (see below for details):
			Satisfy Any
		</Directory>
	</VirtualHost>
	</IfModule>

* For ownCloud to work correctly, we need the module mod_rewrite. Enable it by running::

	sudo a2enmod rewrite

* In distributions that do not come with ``a2enmod``, the module needs to be
  enabled manually by editing the Apache config files, usually :file:`/etc/httpd/httpd.conf`.
  consult the Apache documentation or your distributions documentation.

* In order for the maximum upload size to be configurable, the
  :file:`.htaccess` in the ownCloud folder needs to be made writable by the
  server (this should already be done, see section `Set the Directory Permissions`_).

* You should make sure that any built-in WebDAV module of your web server is disabled
  (at least for the ownCloud directory), as it will interfere with ownCloud's
  built-in WebDAV support.

  If you need the WebDAV support in the rest of your configuration, you can turn it off
  specifically for the ownCloud entry by adding the following line in the
  configuration of your ownCloud. In above "<Directory ..." code, add the following line
  directly after the ``allow from all`` / ``Require all granted`` line): ::

	Dav Off

* Furthermore, you need to disable any server-configured authentication for ownCloud, as
  it's internally using Basic authentication for its \*DAV services.
  If you have turned on authentication on a parent folder (via e.g. an ``AuthType Basic``
  directive), you can turn off the authentication specifically for the ownCloud entry;
  to do so, in above "<Directory ..." code, add the following line directly after the
  ``allow from all`` / ``Require all granted`` line): ::

	Satisfy Any

* When using ssl, take special note on the ServerName. You should specify one in the
  server configuration, as well as in the CommonName field of the certificate. If you want
  your ownCloud to be reachable via the internet, then set both these to the domain you
  want to reach your ownCloud under.

.. note:: By default, the certificates' CommonName will get set to the host name at the time
          when the ssl-cert package was installed.

* Finally, restart Apache.

  * For Ubuntu systems (or distributions using upstartd), run::

	sudo service apache2 restart

  * For systemd systems (Fedora, Arch Linux, OpenSUSE), run::

	systemctl restart httpd.service

Nginx Configuration
*******************

-  You need to insert the following code into **your nginx config file.**
-  Adjust **server_name**, **root**, **ssl_certificate** and **ssl_certificate_key** to suit your needs.
-  Make sure your SSL certificates are readable by the server (see `Nginx HTTP SSL Module documentation`_).

                    access_log off;
            }

    }

.. note:: You can use ownCloud without SSL/TLS support, but we strongly encourage you not to do that:

-  Remove the server block containing the redirect
-  Change **listen 443 ssl** to **listen 80;**
-  Remove **ssl_certificate** and **ssl_certificate_key**.
-  Remove **fastcgi_params HTTPS on;**

.. note:: If you want to effectively increase maximum upload size you will also
          have to modify your **php-fpm configuration** (**usually at
          /etc/php5/fpm/php.ini**) and increase **upload_max_filesize** and
          **post_max_size** values. You’ll need to restart php5-fpm and nginx
	  services in order these changes to be applied.

Lighttpd Configuration
**********************

This assumes that you are familiar with installing PHP application on
lighttpd.

It is important to note that the :file:`.htaccess` used by ownCloud to
protect the :file:`data` folder are ignored by lighttpd, so you have to secure
it by yourself, otherwise your :file:`owncloud.db` database and user data are
publicly readable even if directory listing is off. You need to add two
snippets to your lighttpd configuration file:

Disable access to data folder::

	$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/owncloud/data/" {
		url.access-deny = ("")
	}

Disable directory listing::

	$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/owncloud($|/)" {
		dir-listing.activate = "disable"
	}

**Note for Lighttpd users on Debian stable (wheezy):**

Recent versions of ownCloud make use of the **HTTP PATCH** feature, which was added to Lighttpd at version 1.4.32 while Debian stable only ships 1.4.31. The patch is simple, however, and easy to integrate if you're willing to build your own package.

Download the patch from http://redmine.lighttpd.net/attachments/download/1370/patch.patch

Make sure you have the build tools you need::

    apt-get build-dep lighttpd
    apt-get install quilt patch devscripts

Patch the package source::

    apt-get source lighttpd
    cd lighttpd-1.4.31
    export QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches # This tells quilt to put the patch in the right spot
    quilt new http-patch.patch
    quilt add src/connections.c src/keyvalue.c src/keyvalue.h # Make quilt watch the files we'll be changing
    patch -p1 -i /patch/to/downloaded/patch.patch
    quilt refresh

Increment the package version with ``dch -i``. This will open the changelog with a new entry. You can save as-is or add info to it. The important bit is that the version is bumped so apt will not try to "upgrade" back to Debian's version.

Then build with ``debuild`` and install the .debs for any Lighttpd packages you already have installed.

Yaws Configuration
******************

This should be in your **yaws_server.conf**. In the configuration file, the
**dir_listings = false** is important and also the redirect from **/data**
to somewhere else, because files will be saved in this directory and it
should not be accessible from the outside. A configuration file would look
like this

.. code-block:: xml

    <server owncloud.myserver.com/>
            port = 80
            listen = 0.0.0.0
            docroot = /var/www/owncloud/src
            allowed_scripts = php
            php_handler = <cgi, /usr/local/bin/php-cgi>
            errormod_404 = yaws_404_to_index_php
            access_log = false
            dir_listings = false
            <redirect>
                    /data == /
            </redirect>
    </server>

The Apache :file:`.htaccess` that comes with ownCloud is configured to
redirect requests to non-existent pages. To emulate that behaviour, you
need a custom error handler for yaws. See this
`github gist for further instructions`_ on how to create and compile that error
handler.

Hiawatha Configuration
**********************

Add ``WebDAVapp = yes`` to the ownCloud virtual host. Users accessing
WebDAV from MacOS will also need to add ``AllowDotFiles = yes``.

Disable access to data folder::

    UrlToolkit {
        ToolkitID = denyData
        Match ^/data DenyAccess
    }



Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
