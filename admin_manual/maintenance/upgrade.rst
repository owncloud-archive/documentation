How to Upgrade Your ownCloud Server
===================================

There are three ways to upgrade your ownCloud server:

* Using your :doc:`Linux package manager <package_upgrade>` with our official
  ownCloud repositories. This is the recommended method.
* With the :doc:`Updater App <update>` (Server Edition only). Recommended for
  shared hosters, and for users who want an easy way to track different
  release channels. (It is not available and not supported on the Enterprise
  edition.)
* :doc:`Manually upgrading <manual_upgrade>` with the ownCloud ``.tar`` archive
  from `owncloud.org/install/`_.
* Enterprise Subscription customers will use their Enterprise software
  repositories to maintain their ownCloud servers, rather than the Open Build
  Service. Please see :doc:`../enterprise_installation/linux_installation` for
  more information.

When an update is available for your ownCloud server, you will see a
notification at the top of your ownCloud Web interface. When you click the
notification it brings you here, to this page.

**It is best to keep your ownCloud server upgraded regularly**, and to install
all point releases and major releases without skipping any of them, as skipping
releases increases the risk of errors. Major releases are 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, and
9.0. Point releases are intermediate releases for each major release. For
example, 8.0.9 and 8.1.3 are point releases. **Skipping major releases is not
supported.**

**Upgrading is disruptive**. Your ownCloud server will be put into maintenance
mode, so your users will be locked out until the upgrade is completed. Large
installations may take several hours to complete the upgrade.

.. note:: **Downgrading is not supported** and risks corrupting your data! If
   you want to revert to an older ownCloud version, make a new, fresh
   installation and then restore your data from backup. Before doing this,
   file a support ticket (if you have paid support) or ask for help in the
   ownCloud forums to see if your issue can be resolved without downgrading.

Update Notifier and Updater App Are Not the Same
------------------------------------------------

ownCloud has two update tools: the ownCloud core update notifier, and the
Updater app. Figure 1 shows what you see when the Updater app is enabled: both
the core notifier and the Updater app control panel are visible on your admin
page.

   :alt: Both update mechanisms displayed on Admin page.

   *Figure 1: The top yellow banner is the update notifier, and the Updates
   section is the Updater app.*

The core update notifier has only one function, and that is to display a
notification when a new ownCloud release is available. Then you decide which
upgrade method to use. When you maintain your ownCloud server via your Linux
package manager you should ensure that the Updater app is disabled.

Prerequisites
-------------

You should always maintain :doc:`regular backups <backup>` and make a fresh
backup before every upgrade.

Then review third-party apps, if you have any, for compatibility with the new
ownCloud release. Any apps that are not developed by ownCloud show a 3rd party
designation. **Install unsupported apps at your own risk**. Then, before the
upgrade, all 3rd party apps must be disabled. After the upgrade is complete you
may re-enable them.
