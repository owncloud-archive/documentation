Upgrade ownCloud From Packages
==============================

.. note:: Starting with ownCloud 8.2 the Linux package repositories have
   changed, and **you must configure your system to use these new
   repositories** to install or upgrade ownCloud 8.2+. The new repositories are
   at our `Open Build Service`_.

Upgrade Quickstart
------------------

The core upgrade notifier tells you when a new ownCloud release is available.
If you click on it, it takes you to :doc:`upgrade`.

    interface.

The best method for keeping ownCloud current on Linux servers is by configuring
your system to use ownCloud's `Open Build Service`_ repository. Then stay
current by using your Linux package manager to install fresh ownCloud packages.
After installing upgraded packages you must run a few more steps to complete the
upgrade. These are the basic steps to upgrading ownCloud:

* :doc:`Disable <../installation/apps_management_installation>` all third-party
  apps.
* Make a :doc:`fresh backup <backup>`.
* Install new packages from the ownCloud `Open Build Service`_.
* Take your ownCloud server out of :doc:`maintenance mode
  <enable_maintenance>`.
* Run the :ref:`upgrade wizard <upgrade_wizard_label>` or
  ``occ upgrade`` (optionally disabling the :ref:`migration test
  <migration_test_label>`).
* :ref:`apply strong permissions <strong_perms_label>` to your
  ownCloud directories.
* Re-enable third-party apps.

Upgrading With Your Linux Package Manager
-----------------------------------------

Upgrading ownCloud from our `Open Build Service`_ repository is just like any
normal Linux upgrade. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu Linux this is the
standard system upgrade command::

 apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

Or you can upgrade just ownCloud with this command::

 apt-get update && apt-get install owncloud

On Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Linux use ``yum`` to see all available updates::

 yum check-update

You can apply all available updates with this command::

 yum update

Or update only ownCloud::

 yum update owncloud

Your Linux package manager only downloads the current ownCloud packages. Then
your ownCloud server is immediately put into maintenance mode. You may not see
this until you refresh your ownCloud page.

To complete the upgrade take your server out of maintenance mode. You can do
this by changing ``'maintenance' => true,`` to ``'maintenance' => false,`` in
``config.php``, or use the :doc:`occ command
<../configuration_server/occ_command>`, like this example on Ubuntu::

 sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:mode --off

You must run ``occ`` as your HTTP user.

.. _upgrade_wizard_label:

Upgrade Wizard
--------------

The final step is to run the upgrade wizard to perform the final steps of
updating your apps and database. Refresh your ownCloud page and you will see a
screen with some warnings about backups and a **Start Update** button.
(Alternatively, you may use ``occ upgrade``, which is covered in the next
section.) Click the **Start Update** button:

The wizard will put ownCloud back into maintenance mode, display a
status screen while the upgrade is running, and when it is completed take it
out of maintenance mode and return you to your ownCloud session.

occ Upgrade
-----------

If you have shell access it is better to **not** click the **Start Update**
button, but rather to use ``occ upgrade``. ``occ upgrade`` is more reliable,
especially on installations with large datasets and large numbers of users
because it avoids the risk of PHP timeouts. This example is for CentOS::

 sudo -u apache php occ upgrade
  ownCloud or one of the apps require upgrade - only a limited number of
  commands are available
  Set log level to debug - current level: 'Warning'
  Turned on maintenance mode
  Checking whether the database schema can be updated (this can take a long
  time depending on the database size)
  Checked database schema update
  Checking updates of apps
  Checked database schema update for apps
  Updating database schema
  Updated database
  Update successful
  Turned off maintenance mode
  Reset log level to 'Warning'

Remember, you must run ``occ`` as your HTTP user. When it is completed refresh
your ownCloud Web page to return to your previous session.

.. _migration_test_label:

Migration Test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before completing the upgrade, ownCloud first runs a simulation by copying all
database tables to new tables, and then performs the upgrade on them, to ensure
that the upgrade will complete correctly. The copied tables are deleted after
the upgrade. This takes twice as much time, which on large installations can be
many hours, so you can omit this step with the ``--skip-migration-test``
option, like this example on CentOS::

 $ sudo -u apache php occ upgrade --skip-migration-test

Setting Strong Directory Permissions
------------------------------------

After upgrading, verify that your ownCloud directory permissions are set
according to :ref:`strong_perms_label`.

If the upgrade fails, then you must try a manual upgrade.
