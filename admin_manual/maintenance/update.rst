Upgrading ownCloud with the Updater App
=======================================

The Updater app automates many of the steps of updating an ownCloud
installation. You should keep your ownCloud server updated and not skip any
releases. The Updater app is enabled in your ownCloud Server instance by
default, which you can confirm by looking on your Apps page.

.. note:: The Updater app is **not enabled and not supported** in ownCloud
   Enterprise Subscription.

   The Updater app is **not included** in the
   `Linux packages on our Open Build Service
   <https://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/stable/owncloud/>`_,
   but only in the `tar and zip archives
   <https://owncloud.org/install/#instructions-server>`_. When you install
   ownCloud from packages you should keep it updated with your package manager.

   **Downgrading** is not supported and risks corrupting your data! If you want
   to revert to an older ownCloud version, install it from scratch and then
   restore your data from backup. Before doing this, file a support ticket (if
   you have paid support) or ask for help in the ownCloud forums to see if your
   issue can be resolved without downgrading.

The Updater App is not required, and it is recommended to use other methods for
keeping your ownCloud server up-to-date, if possible. (See :doc:`upgrade`.) The
Updater App is useful for installations that do not have root access,
such as shared hosting, for installations with a smaller number of users
and data, and it automates updating
:doc:`manual installations<../installation/source_installation>`.

You should maintain regular backups (see :doc:`backup`), and make a backup
before every update. The Updater app does not backup your database or data
directory.

The Updater app performs these operations:

* Creates an ``updater_backup`` directory under your ownCloud data directory
* Download and extracts updated package content into the
  ``updater_backup/packageVersion`` directory
* Makes a copy of your current ownCloud instance, except for your data
  directory, to  ``updater_backup/currentVersion-randomstring``
* Moves all directories except ``data``, ``config`` and ``themes`` from the
  current instance to ``updater_backup/tmp``
* Moves all directories from ``updater_backup/packageVersion`` to the current
  version
* Copies your old ``config.php`` to the new ``config/`` directory

Using the Updater app to update your ownCloud installation is just a few
steps:

1.  You should see a notification at the top of any ownCloud page when there is
    a new update available:

.. figure:: images/upgrade-notifier.png
   :alt: upgrade notifier banner.

2.  Even though the Updater app backs up important directories, you should
    always have your own current backups (See :doc:`backup` for details.)

3.  Verify that the HTTP user on your system can write to your whole ownCloud
    directory; see the :ref:`set_updating_permissions_label` section below.

4.  Navigate to your Admin page and click the `Update Center` button under
    Updater. This takes you to the Updater control panel.

5.  Click Update, and carefully read the messages. If there are any problems it
    will tell you. The most common issue is directory permissions; your HTTP
    user needs write permissions to your whole ownCloud directory. (See
    :ref:`strong_perms_label`.) Otherwise you will see messages
    about checking your installation and making backups.

6.  Click Proceed, and then it performs the remaining steps, which takes a few
    minutes.

7.  If your directory permissions are correct, a backup was made, and
    downloading the new ownCloud archive succeeded you will see the following
    screen. Click the Start Update button to complete your update:

.. figure:: images/upgrade-2.png
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: ownCloud upgrade wizard screen.

..  note:: If you have a large ownCloud installation, at this point you
    should use the ``occ upgrade`` command, running it as your HTTP user,
    instead of clicking the Start Update button, in order to avoid PHP
    timeouts. The ``occ`` command does not download ownCloud updates.
    You must first download and install the updated code, and then ``occ``
    performs the final upgrade steps.  This example is for Ubuntu Linux::

     $ sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade

Before completing the upgrade, ownCloud first runs a simulation by copying all
database tables to new tables, and then performs the upgrade on them, to ensure
that the upgrade will complete correctly. The copied tables are deleted after
the upgrade. This takes twice as much time, which on large installations can be
many hours, so you can omit this step with the ``--skip-migration-test``
option, like this example on Ubuntu::

 $ sudo -u www-data php occ upgrade --skip-migration-test

See :doc:`../configuration_server/occ_command` to learn more.

8.  It runs for a few minutes, and when it is finished displays a success
    message, which disappears after a short time.

Refresh your Admin page to verify your new version number. In the Updater
section of your Admin page you can see the current status and backups. These
are backups of your old and new ownCloud installations, and do not contain your
data files. If your update works and there are no problems you can delete the
backups from this screen.

If the update fails, then you must update manually. (See :doc:`upgrade`.)

Can't Login Without Updating
----------------------------

If you can't login to your ownCloud installation without performing an update
first, this means that updated ownCloud files have already been downloaded to
your server, most likely via your Linux package manager during a routine system
update. So you only need to click the Start Update button, or run the ``occ``
command to complete the update.

.. _set_updating_permissions_label:

Setting Permissions for Updating
--------------------------------

For hardened security we  highly recommend setting the permissions on your
ownCloud directory as strictly as possible. These commands should be executed
immediately after the initial installation. Please follow the steps in
:ref:`strong_perms_label`.

These strict permissions will prevent the Updater app from working, as it needs
your whole ownCloud directory to be owned by the HTTP user. Run this script to
set the appropriate permissions for updating. Replace the ``ocpath`` variable
with the path to your ownCloud directory, and replace the ``htuser`` and
``htgroup`` variables with your HTTP user and group.::

    #!/bin/bash
    # Sets permissions of the owncloud instance for updating

    ocpath='/var/www/owncloud'
    htuser='www-data'
    htgroup='www-data'

    chown -R ${htuser}:${htgroup} ${ocpath}

You can find your HTTP user in your HTTP server configuration files. Or you can
use :ref:`label-phpinfo` (Look for the **User/Group** line).

* The HTTP user and group in Debian/Ubuntu is ``www-data``.
* The HTTP user and group in Fedora/CentOS is ``apache``.
* The HTTP user and group in Arch Linux is ``http``.
* The HTTP user in openSUSE is ``wwwrun``, and the HTTP group is ``www``.

After the update is completed, re-apply the strong directory permissions
immediately by running the script in :ref:`strong_perms_label`.
