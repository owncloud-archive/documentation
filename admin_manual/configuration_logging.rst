Logging Configuration
=====================

To get an idea of how the current status of an ownCloud system is or to
solve issues log information is a good point to start with. ownCloud allows
to configure the way how and which depth of information should be logged.

Parameters
----------

  First you need to decide in which way logging should be done. You can
  choose between the two options ``owncloud`` and ``syslog``. Then you need
  to configure the log level which directly influences how much information
  will be logged. You can choose between ``0=DEBUG``, ``1=INFO``, ``2=WARN``
  and ``3=ERROR``.
  The most detailed information will be written if ``0`` (DEBUG) is set, the
  least information will be written if ``3`` (ERROR) is set. Keep in mind that
  it might slow down the whole system if a too detailed logging will has been
  configured. By default the log level is set to ``2`` (WARN).

  **owncloud**
  - All log information will be written to a separate log file which can be
  viewed using the log menu in the admin menu of ownCloud. By default a log
  file named ``owncloud.log`` will be created in the directory which has
  been configured by the ``datadirectory`` parameter.
  ::

    "log_type" => "owncloud",
    "logfile" => "owncloud.log",
    "loglevel" => "3",

  **syslog**
  - All log information will be send to the default syslog deamon of a system.
  ::

    "log_type" => "syslog",
    "logfile" => "",
    "loglevel" => "3",
