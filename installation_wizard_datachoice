When installing ownCloud Server & ownCloud Enterprise editions the administrator
may choose one of 3 supported database products.

SQLite
^^^^^^
Is the default database for ownCloud Server, but is not available and not supported
for the ownCloud Enterprise edition.

SQLite will be installed by the ownCloud packages and all the necessary dependencies
will be satisfied.  See :doc:`source_installation` for a detailed listing of
required and optional PHP modules.

If you used the packages to install ownCloud, you may "Finish Setup" with no
additional steps to configure ownCloud using the SQLite database for limited use.

Please note that SQLite is good only for testing and lightweight single user setups.
There is no client synchronization support.  Therefore, other devices will not be able
to synchronize with the data stored in an ownCloud SQLite database.

MYSQL/MariaDB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Is the ownCloud recommended database.  It may be used with either ownCloud Server or
ownCloud Enterprise editions.

First you should install the recommended MySQL/MariaDB database.  Use package: 
  ``sudo apt-get install mariadb-server``

If you have an administrator login that has permissions to create and modify databases,
you may choose "Storage & Database".  Then enter your database administrator name, 
password and any name you want for your ownCloud database.

Otherwise, use these steps to create temporary database administrator account.

  | ``sudo mysql --user=root mysql``
  |
  | ``CREATE USER 'dbadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Apassword';``
  | ``GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dbadmin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;``
  | ``FLUSH PRIVILEGES;``
  |
  | ``exit``

PostgreSQL
^^^^^^^^^^
Is also supported by ownCloud.

To install PostgreSQL, use the apt-get (or other apt-driving) command: 
	``sudo apt-get install postgresql``

You may view more information about the PostgreSQL database system at: 
  ``http://www.postgresql.org``

In order to allow ownCloud access to the database, create a known password for the
default user "postgres" added when the database is installed.
	
  | ``sudo -i -u postgres psql``
  |	
  | ``postgres=# \password``
  | ``Enter new password:`` 
  | ``Enter it again:``
  | ``postgres=# \q``
  |	
  | ``exit``

Oracle11g
^^^^^^^^^
Is only supported for the ownCloud Enterprise edition.


Database Setup By ownCloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Your database and PHP connectors must be installed before you run the Installation Wizard
by clicking the "Finish setup" button.

After you enter your temporary or root administrator login for your database, the installer
creates a special database user with privileges limited to the ownCloud database. Then ownCloud
needs only this special ownCloud database user and drops the temporary or root database login. 

This new user is named from your ownCloud admin user, with an oc_ prefix, and then given a
random password.  The ownCloud database user and password are written into config.ph:

| For MySQL/MariaDB:
|   ``'dbuser' => 'oc_dbadmin',``
|   ``'dbpassword' => 'pX65Ty5DrHQkYPE5HRsDvyFHlZZHcm',``

| For PostgreSQL:
|   ``'dbuser' => 'oc_postgres',``
|   ``'dbpassword' => 'pX65Ty5DrHQkYPE5HRsDvyFHlZZHcm',``
