Using the ownCloud Android App
==============================

Accessing your files on your ownCloud server via the Web interface is easy and 
convenient, as you can use any Web browser on any operating system without 
installing special client software. However, the ownCloud Android app offers 
some advantages over the Web interface:

* A simplified interface that fits nicely on a tablet or smartphone
* Automatic synchronization of your files
* Instant uploads of photos or videos recorded on your Android device
* Easily add files from your device to ownCloud
* Two-factor authentication

Getting the ownCloud Android App
--------------------------------

One way to get your ownCloud Android app is to log into your ownCloud 
server using a Web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Dolphin. The first time 
you log in to a new ownCloud account you'll see a screen with a download link 
to the ownCloud app in the 
`Google Play store
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owncloud.android>`_.

You will also find these links on your Personal page in the Web interface,

You can also get it from the `Amazon App store 
<http://www.amazon.com/ownCloud-Inc/dp/B00944PQMK/>`_, and get source code and 
more information from the `ownCloud download page 
<http://owncloud.org/install/#desktop>`_.

Connecting to Your ownCloud Server
----------------------------------

The first time you run your ownCloud Android app it opens to a configuration 
screen. Enter your server URL, login name, password, and click the Connect 
button.

For best security your ownCloud server should be SSL-enabled, so that you can 
connect via ``https``. The ownCloud app will test your connection as soon as 
you enter it and tell you if you entered it correctly. If your server has a 
self-signed SSL certificate you'll get a scary warning how it is not to be 
trusted. Click the OK button to accept the certificate and complete your account 
setup.
