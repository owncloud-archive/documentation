Configuring External Storage
============================

The External Storage application allows you to mount external storage services, such as Google 
Drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3, SMB/CIFS fileservers, and FTP servers in ownCloud. Your 
ownCloud server administrator controls which of these are available to you. Please see 
``Configuring External Storage (GUI)`` in the ownCloud Administrator's manual for 
configuration howtos and example:
