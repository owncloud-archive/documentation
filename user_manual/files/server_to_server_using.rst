Using Server-to-Server Sharing
==============================

ownCloud 7 introduces a powerful new feature, server-to-server sharing.  With just a few clicks you can easily access shares from other ownCloud 7 servers, link them to your account, and create your own shares. This feature enables you to:

* Selectively share files or directories.
* Combine two private clouds into a single public cloud. 
* Eliminate the need to create user accounts on multiple ownCloud servers.
* View files in a Web browser or ownCloud client.

.. note:: Server-to-server sharing requires that both servers are running
   versions of ownCloud that support this feature; currently this is ownCloud 7.

Creating a New Share
------------------------

Server-to-server sharing is enabled on new or upgraded ownCloud 7 installations
by default. (See "Configuring Server-to-Server Sharing" in the Administrators Manual.) Follow these steps to create a new share:

1. Go to your ``Files`` page and hover your cursor over the file or directory you want to share to expose your administration options. Check the ``Share Link`` checkbox to create the share, and to expose all of your sharing options.

2. Set any options that you want to apply to your new share: send an email notification, add password protection, allow users to upload files to the share, or set an expiration date.

And that's all there is to it. Your new public share is labeled with a chain link. If you do not protect it with a password, it is visible to anyone who has the URL. (ownCloud server admins have the option of requiring users to set passwords on shares in ``Admin > Sharing.``)


Connecting to a Remote Share
-----------------------------

1. Open the share link in your Web browser.

2. Click the ``Add to your ownCloud`` button, and enter the URL of your ownCloud server. 

3. You will see a dialogue asking you ``"Do you want to add the remote share [share name] from [remote server name]?"``

4. Click the ``Add Remote Share`` button, and enjoy your new share. It is marked with a share icon, and the name of the share's owner and originating server.

Remove your linked share anytime by clicking the trash can icon.
