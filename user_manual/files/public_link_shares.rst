==================
Public Link Shares
==================

With ownCloud X (10.0), we introduced the ability to create multiple public links per file or folder.
This offers a lot of flexibility for creating different kinds of share links for a single file or folder, such as *different passwords*, *expiry dates*, and *permissions*. 

As of ownCloud version 10.0.2 you can create :ref:`Drop Folders <create_drop_folder_label>`, where users can upload files to a central location, but not be able to change any existing ones, nor see other files which already have been uploaded.

Creating Public Link Shares   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a public link share, first view the Sharing Panel of the file or folder that you want to create a public link share for, and under **"Public Links"** click **"Create public link"**.

Then, as with other shares, provide the name in the **"Link Name"** field, and fill out the options that suit what you want the link to support. 
You can find details of what each option does below.

Finally, click **"Save"** to complete creation of the share. 
Now that the share is created, you can:

- Copy the link to the share and give it out
- Update the shareâ€™s settings
- Share the link via social media and email
- Delete the public link
