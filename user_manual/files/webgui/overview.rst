Display File Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you display details about a file, by clicking "Details" in the Overflow Menu, a set of tabs (or views) are available. These are:

================= =============================================================
View              Description
================= =============================================================
Details           This shows details about a file, such as its name, size, 
                  and when it was created or last updated.
Activity          This shows a history of activity on the file, such as when 
                  it was created, updated, and shared.
Sharing           It's here that shares are managed. To know more, refer to 
                  the `Sharing Files`_ section.
Version           This shows a history of all the versions of the file. This is
                  not available for folders.
