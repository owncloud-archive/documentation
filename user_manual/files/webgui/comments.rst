In ownCloud, you can add one or more comments on both files and folders. This
section describes how to add, edit, and delete comments.

Add Comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the Details view, in :ref:`The Overflow Menu <the_overflow_menu_label>`, to add and read comments on any
file or folder. Comments are visible to everyone who has access to the file or
folder. To add a comment, as in the example below, click the **Comments** tab
in the Details view, write a comment in the New Comment field, and click
"Post".

Edit Comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit an existing comment on a file or folder, hover the mouse over the
comment and you will see a pencil icon appear. By clicking on the pencil, the
*"Edit Comment"* field will appear, pre-filled with the comment text. Change
the text as necessary and click *"Save"*. If you change your mind, just click
*"Cancel"*.

Delete Comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete an existing comment on a file or folder, as with editing comments,
hover the mouse over the comment and you will see a pencil icon appear. Click
the pencil, and a rubbish bin icon appears on the far right-hand side of the
comment author's name, above the *"Edit Comment"* text field. Click the rubbish
bin, and the comment will be deleted after a few seconds.
