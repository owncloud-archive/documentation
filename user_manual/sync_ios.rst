Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Check that you didn't include http:// or https:// in the server address.
#. Depending on your server setup the username-part of the server-address may be case sensitive. So for user ``Username`` the server-address may need to be ``ADDRESS/remote.php/caldav/principals/Username`` instead of ``ADDRESS/remote.php/caldav/principals/username``
#. If you need to change the server-address and want to use SSL you'll have to cancel the setup process and enter your data again from the very beginning, as iOS would prepend https:// to the server-address automatically.
#.  Problems have been reported for CardDAV and iOS 4.X. A possible solution is at the `forum`.
