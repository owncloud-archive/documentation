You can access your music stored in ownCloud with every
Ampache-compatible media player. You can find the URL for your specific
ownCloud installation in your personal settings, or replace ADDRESS with
the URL of your ownCloud installation yourself.

``Ampache-URL: http://ADDRESS/remote.php/ampache/``

Ampache-compatible players that work with ownCloud include:

-  `amaroK`_, standard KDE music player
-  `tomahawk`_, cross platform player
-  `justplayer`_, music player for android

You can find more information about Ampache and other players at the

The current maintainer of the Media Player is Robin Appelman.
