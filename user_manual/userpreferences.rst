.. note:: If you are an administrator, you can also manage users and administer the server by using the related links in the Personal Settings Menu. However, these links do not appear to a normal user.

The options listed in the Personal Settings Page depend on the applications that are enabled by the administrator.  However, some of the default settings for this page include the following:

* Usage and available quota -- Appearing at the top of the page, this information provides the amount of space used and available for the user (in Megabytes).

* Password -- Enables you to change your password.  To change your password, you must provide your current password along with your new password.  When creating a new password, ownCloud provides a dynamic password strength indicator for your assistance.

  .. note:: If you would like the ability to recover your password through e-mail, specify your email address in the Email field (see below).

* Full Name -- Enables you to specify your full name.  This name appears at the top of the Personal Settings Menu.

 * Profile picture -- Enables you to specify a new avatar (profile image) that identifies you on the ownCloud server.  By default, the profile picture is the first initial of your username.  You can choose to keep the letter designation, upload a new image from an external source, or select an image from any existing images in your ownCloud folders.

You can obtain notifications hourly, daily, or weekly.
