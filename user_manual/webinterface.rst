Navigating the Main User Interface
------------------------------------

By default, the ownCloud Web interface opens to your Files page.
Once you have accessed the ownCloud Server main web interface you can add files, 
remove files, and make changes based on the access privileges set by you
(if you are administering the server) or by your server administrator.
