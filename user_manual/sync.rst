Desktop Synchronisation
========================

For synchronizing files with your desktop computer, we recommend using the
`ownCloud Client`_ for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

The ownCloud Desktop Client enables you to connect to your private ownCloud Server. 
You can create folders in your home directory, and keep the contents of those 
folders synced with your ownCloud server. Simply copy a file into the directory 
and the ownCloud desktop client does the rest. Make a change to the files on one 
computer, it will flow across the others using these desktop sync clients. Always 
have your latest files with you wherever you are. 

Its usage is documented separately in the `ownCloud Desktop Client Manual`_.

Furthermore, It is possible to synchronize your ownCloud calendar and address book
with a variety of different operating systems and devices. It is also possible to
mount your ownCloud storage via WebDAV, which is also documented in the next chapters.
