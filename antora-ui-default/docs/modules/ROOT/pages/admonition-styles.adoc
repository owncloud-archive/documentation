An xref:antora:asciidoc:admonitions.adoc[admonition], also known as a notice, helps draw attention to content with a special label or icon.

== Admonition blocks

An admonition block is a table.
The table title element is specified by the block class: tip, note, important, warning, or caution.
Here's an AsciiDoc source example that produces an admonition with the table title warning:

[source,asciidoc]
----
WARNING: Watch out!
----

If font-based icons are enabled (`icons=font`), the table title text is replaced by the associated icon.

[source,html]
----
<div class="admonitionblock warning">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-warning" title="Warning"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Watch out!</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
----

Here's how it might appear when the title is displayed as text:

WARNING: Watch out!
