= UI Macro Styles

Asciidoctor supports xref:antora:asciidoc:ui-macros.adoc[three UI element representations] out of the box, which are made from corresponding inline UI macros.

* button (btn macro)
* keybinding (kbd macro)
* menu (menu macro)

The UI elements are output using semantic HTML elements, so they inherit some default styling from the browser.
However, to look proper, they require some additional styling.

== Button

A xref:antora:asciidoc:ui-macros.adoc#button[button] is meant to represent an on-screen button (`+btn:[Save]+`).
However, it should not appear like an actual button as that could confuse the reader into thinking it's interactive.
Therefore, a button is rendered as a bold text by default:

[source,html]
----
<b class="button">Save</b>
----

Traditionally, a button reference is styled by surrounding the text with square brackets, as shown here:

btn:[Save]

== Keybinding

A xref:antora:asciidoc:ui-macros.adoc#keybinding[keybinding] can be a single key (`+kbd:[F11]+`) or a sequence of keys (`+kbd:[Ctrl+F]`).
Here's the HTML that's generated for these two forms.

[source,html]
----
<kbd>F11</kbd>
<span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd></span>
----

Here's how these might appear:

[%hardbreaks]
kbd:[F11]
kbd:[Ctrl+F]

== Menu

A xref:antora:asciidoc:ui-macros.adoc#menu[menu] can be a top-level menu reference (`+menu:File[]+`) or a nested selection (`+menu:File[Save]+`).
Here's the HTML that's generated for these two forms.

[source,html]
----
<b class="menuref">File</b>
<span class="menuseq"><b class="menu">File</b>&#160;<b class="caret">&#8250;</b> <b class="menuitem">Save</b></span>
----

This might be rendered as:

menu:File[]

menu:File[Save]

The default styling applied to a menu reference is usually sufficient.
