ownCloud Documentation Workflow
===============================

This describes the workflow and required tools for writing and maintaining the ownCloud Admin, User, Developer, Desktop Sync Client, Android, and iOS client manuals.

Quickstart
----------

The documentation publishing workflow operates in this order:

Git > Sphinx > GitHub > Jenkins > doc.owncloud.com and doc.owncloud.org

Clone the appropriate ownCloud GitHub repos to your PC.
Branch the appropriate repo, and then write and edit the docs using Sphinx/RST.
Make local builds to test for errors.
Commit and push your branch to GitHub and open a pull request.
Tag the appropriate reviewers. You need two thumbs-up to merge.
Backport as necessary using ``git cherry-pick``.
Mr. Jenkins publishes all changes on GitHub.

Required accounts
-----------------
GitHub, VPN, Jenkins https://rotor.int.owncloud.com/ (Jenkins is behind the VPN), customer.owncloud.com/customer, Docker launcher docker.oc.solidgear.es, s3.owncloud.com/owncloud/

Required software:

#. Git
#. Sphinx Documentation Generator and Python
#. Python Image Library (PIL)
#. Sphinx PHPDomain
#. rst2pdf
#. LaTex. Install the whole works, which is several hundred megabytes.
#. VPN client, such as OpenVPN

The README on https://github.com/owncloud/documentation has instructions for setting up your build environment.

Release Updates
---------------

Sphinx/RST supports some variable substitutions, for example see the title in ``admin_manual/index.rst``, where the version is pulled from ``conf.py.``. However, there are some URLs that have to be manually updated; ``grep`` is your best friend for finding these. 

Tracking Tasks
--------------

Put everything in a GitHub issue. When anyone suggests a correction, have them open an issue. (Even better is they create a pull request.) You can assign people to Issues, give them milestones, labels, and sort and filter them.

Document Formats
----------------

The build system creates HTML pages and PDF manuals. ``conf.py`` controls version numbers, titles, and build options. Read the ``Makefile`` to see the complete list of output formats and commands.

The PDF manuals have formatting problems because they are generated from the same source files as the HTML pages. On the Web sites images resize automatically according to window size. But the PDFs print the original image size, and image placement in LaTex is always "fun". The solution may be to separate the HTML and PDF builds, if there is ever time and resources.

All Documentation Repos
-----------------------

The technical writer is the boss of these repos.

Admin, User, and Developer manuals. 
 https://github.com/owncloud/documentation
  
Index page for doc.owncloud.com 
 https://github.com/owncloud/doc-index-com
 
Index page for doc.owncloud.org 
 https://github.com/owncloud/doc-index-org
 
Documentation Wiki, any GitHub member can contribute
 https://github.com/owncloud/documentation/wiki 
 
The manuals are integrated into the following repos, so the technical writer follows their rules for publishing changes.
 
Android app manual 
 https://github.com/owncloud/android

Desktop sync client manual
 https://github.com/owncloud/client
 
iOS app manual 
 https://github.com/owncloud/ios
 
Branded clients manual
 https://github.com/owncloud/branded_clients
 
The master config.sample.php
 https://github.com/owncloud/core/tree/master/config
 
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/9.2/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html is manually generated from the master config.sample.php with the conversion script at https://github.com/MorrisJobke/ownCloud-config-converter Download the conversion script, make the conversion to ``config_sample_php_parameters.rst``, and then push it to GitHub like any other document.

ownCloud Appliance admin manual
 https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/tree/master/appliance/vagrant/oc9ee
 
Enterprise documentation repo. This is obsolete and not used, but enterprise support people still post issues here. 
 https://github.com/owncloud/documentation-enterprise
 
 owncloud.org and Obsolete Manuals
 ---------------------------------
 
The repository for owncloud.org is https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud.org. owncloud.com has its own separate system somewhere. I have been marking obsolete manuals with an "Unsupported" banner. The .org site templates are in the ``_shared_assets`` directory. See https://github.com/owncloud/documentation/commit/26022bb489218120977592409755152e63973d19 for example code, and https://doc.owncloud.org/server/8.0/user_manual/ to see how it looks. The manuals are left up because they come up in Google searches, so the banner tells users where to find current manuals.

Obsolete Pages
--------------

When you remove manual pages or change the paths, the old pages remain on the server. This is a problem because the obsolete pages come up in Google searches. Keep track of these pages and open a ticket with the sysadmin team to delete them from the server. (There may be a way to do this in Jenkins.)
